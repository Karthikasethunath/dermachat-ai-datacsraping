        "What is acanthosis nigricans?": "Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition in which the skin becomes thickened and has a dark velvety appearance. It is most commonly in the armpits, around the neck, the groin and under the breasts. The skin changes of acanthosis nigricans rarely causes complications. However, scratching, or excessive scrubbing of the area can cause breaks in the skin and infection. ",
        "Who gets acanthosis nigricans?": "Acanthosis nigricans is most frequently seen in overweight individuals and is believed to be related to insulin resistance. A United States study reported acanthosis nigricans in 74% of individuals with obesity. 1 It may also develop in overweight adolescents and children. This condition can also more severely affect those with skin of colour. Acanthosis nigricans can be associated with endocrine or metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, Cushing’s syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome and thyroid disease. ",
        "What causes acanthosis nigricans?": "The cause of acanthosis nigricans remains unclear, but is predominantly linked to insulin resistance, where obesity, diabetes or metabolic disorders co-exist. Medications may cause acanthosis nigricans as a side effect, such as glucocorticoids, insulin, oral contraceptives, testosterone and aripiprazole. There are also some rare inherited causes of acanthosis nigricans, which present in early childhood and may be accompanied by other abnormalities in growth and other organs. In very rare cases, sudden onset and widespread acanthosis nigricans involving hands and feet (particularly in a individual who is unwell and has lost weight) may herald cancer. The cancers are most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract. ",
        "What does acanthosis nigricans look like?": "Acanthosis nigricans typically appears as symmetrical, thickened, grey-brown and raised velvety areas of skin. Most commonly the lesions appear on the back and sides of the neck, underarms, and groin, but can affect other skin fold areas such as the knuckles of the hand, soles of the feet, knees and elbows. The thickened skin is not itchy or sore. Skin tags are common and may develop in or around the affected areas. In some cases, skin tags may appear on mucosal surfaces, such as the mouth. Figure 1.

        "How is acanthosis nigricans diagnosed?": "Acanthosis nigricans is diagnosed clinically through history and examination of the skin. A skin sample (biopsy) may be taken when the diagnosis is uncertain. As acanthosis nigricans is usually a sign of an underlying disease, other tests may be performed looking for diseases, such as diabetes or insulin resistance. ",
        "How is acanthosis nigricans treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The main treatment of acanthosis nigricans is to manage the underlying disease. Weight loss in individuals with obesity can result in significant improvement of lesions or complete resolution. Other treatments may include: Individuals with acanthosis nigricans may sometimes mistakenly believe that their skin is dirty or that they need to excessively scrub the affected areas. This should be avoided as it can cause further thickening and darkening of the skin. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of acanthosis nigricans?": "The underlying disease needs to be identified and addressed as outcome of acanthosis nigricans will vary depending on the cause and severity. Those with insulin resistance and obesity-related acanthosis nigricans are at risk of developing diabetes, and associated heart and kidney complications. Inherited acanthosis nigricans may stabilise or completely clear on their own without the need for targeted treatment. Individuals with malignant acanthosis nigricans generally have a short average survival time. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "What is acne keloidalis nuchae?": "Acne keloidalis nuchae (AKN) is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects hair follicles on the back of the neck. It may occur in combination with other conditions including hidradenitis suppurativa, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, pilonidal sinus and acne conglobata. The term AKN can be confusing because the condition is not acne and the scars formed are not true keloids. ",
        "Who gets acne keloidalis nuchae?": "AKN is mostly seen in men of African-Caribbean background, but it may also be seen in those of Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean backgrounds, and in rare cases, Caucasians. It is 20 times more common in males than in females1. ",
        "What causes acne keloidalis nuchae?": "The cause of AKN is poorly understood. Factors that may cause AKN include: ",
        "What does acne keloidalis nuchae look like?": "In the early stages of the condition, small firm bumps, pimples and crusts form around the hair follicles on the back of the scalp (occipital scalp). These papules can be painful and itchy. As the condition progresses, the bumps become small scars that extend from the back of the neck up to the top of the scalp and then enlarge to become keloid-like masses. In severe cases, irreversible scarring hair loss (alopecia) and/or abscesses with draining pus may occur. Tufted (“doll-like”) hairs may exist; these are multiple hair shafts from one hair follicle opening. Figure 1. Acne keloidalis Nuchae on the back of the neck. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Michelle Rodrigues ",
        "How is acne keloidalis nuchae diagnosed?": "AKN is diagnosed clinically through history and examination by finding bumps, pimples and scars on the scalp. In some cases, a skin sample (biopsy) of the scalp may be required to diagnose AKN and distinguish it from other forms of scarring hair loss that look similar. ",
        "How is acne keloidalis nuchae treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. AKN may often persist despite a variety of treatments. AKN treatment is aimed at preventing scarring and permanent hair loss, and may include: Surgical treatment or radiotherapy of the scarred area may be used for cases that are advanced or treatment resistant. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of acne keloidalis nuchae?": "While there is no cure, AKN can be treated if diagnosed early. It can be difficult to treat once scarring has developed.

        "What are acne scars?": "Acne scars are permanent textural changes and indentations that occur on the skin due to severe acne. They often appear on the face, and sometimes on the back and chest. The term “scarring” is not used for the temporary red and brown marks left early after acne has occurred as these marks will almost always improve without treatment. ",
        "Who gets acne scars?": "Individuals with moderate or severe acne are more likely to develop acne scars. It is particularly common in nodulocystic acne, acne conglobata, acne fulminans and infantile acne. ",
        "What causes acne scars?": "When large pus-filled acne cysts penetrate deep in the skin, they damage the surrounding skin tissue. If not enough collagen is produced during the healing process, an indentation (scar) is left on the skin. If too much collagen is produced, scarring can be lumpy, known as “hypertrophic” or “keloid” scarring. These scars often occur on the chest and back. ",

        "What does acne vulgaris look like?": "Acne mostly occurs on the face, chest, and trunk. Many different types of acne spots can occur, often at the same time. Whiteheads are small, often tiny, non-inflamed spots under the skin surface while blackheads appear as an open pore with a black plug. Whiteheads and blackheads are usually the first lesions that develop and may, but not always, be followed by the development of red lumps and pustules. If the acne becomes more inflamed, larger, redder, deeper and more tender nodules or cysts may develop. These very inflamed lesions often lead to scarring. Some drug reactions may result in many small pustules developing on the face and trunk. These reactions are sometimes described as “acneiform drug eruptions”. These can be distinguished from acne because of the absence of comedones (blackheads or whiteheads). Figure 1. Whiteheads – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Jo-Ann See Figure 2.

Some causes may include: Acquired ichthyosis associated with cancers The most common cancer associated with acquired ichthyosis is Hodgkin’s disease (a lymphoma). Skin changes may occur prior to, during and post treatment of the lymphoma. Other cancers associated with acquired ichthyosis includes: Acquired ichthyosis and other diseases Acquired ichthyosis can be caused by autoimmune conditions, nutritional deficiencies, metabolic diseases, or infections. Malnutrition or malabsorption diseases such as Crohn’s disease, pancreatic sufficiency, and coeliac disease, may lead to poor absorption of fats and vitamins and development of acquired ichthyosis. Other conditions, including chronic liver disease, kidney failure, thyroid and parathyroid diseases, sarcoidosis, leprosy, bone marrow-related conditions and autoimmune connective tissue diseases, such as lupus and dermatomyositis, may also cause acquired ichthyosis.

        "Who gets actinic keratoses?": "Some individuals are more at risk in developing actinic keratoses, such as: ",
        "What causes actinic keratoses?": "Too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun cause nearly all actinic keratoses. UV radiation penetrates the upper layers of the skin and can cause changes to its structure and appearance. Repeated UV exposure can also damage some of the genetic material (DNA) in skin cells causing chemical changes and mutations. It also impairs the skin’s immune system and its ability to repair any damage. ",
        "What do actinic keratoses look like?": "The appearance of actinic keratoses can vary: Actinic keratoses can occur as a single, isolated lesion, but there are more often multiple. They are commonly found on areas of the body that are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, forearms, backs of hands and lower legs. They may be asymptomatic, itchy or sensitive to touch. Actinic keratoses can also affect the lips and this is known as actinic cheilitis. Figure 1.

        "How are actinic keratoses diagnosed?": "Actinic keratoses are usually diagnosed clinically from their physical appearance. In some cases, dermoscopy may be useful in diagnosing actinic keratoses. However, in cases of doubt, or if progression to SCC is suspected, a skin sample (biopsy) may be necessary. ",
        "How are actinic keratoses treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs, and whether it is a single keratosis or multiple keratoses being treated. Actinic keratoses treatment is aimed at preventing the lesions from turning into skin cancers, and improving the appearance and texture of the skin. There are many treatment options available, such as: Pretreatment with keratolytics such as salicylic acid or topical retinoid creams may be used to help improve sun damaged skin and improve response to treatment. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of actinic keratoses?": "Most actinic keratoses can be treated and cured. If they are found and treated early, they may not develop into skin cancer. In some cases, actinic keratoses may recur months or years after treatment, and new ones are likely to develop. They are also associated with an increased risk of developing skin cancers, particularly SCC. It is important that a combination of sun protection measures are used, including the wearing of sun protective clothing, correct use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen, wearing of a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses to reduce the risk of developing new actinic keratoses. Oral Vitamin B3 may also reduce the number and severity of actinic keratoses. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

It is characterised by a rash that causes sudden swelling and redness of the skin and the development of small white pus-filled spots (pustules). It typically starts on the face or on the inner elbows, behind the knees, armpits, groin and neck (flexural areas). ",
        "Who gets acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis?": "AGEP is mainly seen in adults but can occur in children. The estimated incidence of AGEP is 1 to 5 cases per 1,000,000 people per year.(1) ",
        "What causes acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis?": "Medications are the cause of AGEP in more than 90% of cases.(2-3) Antibiotics are the main cause, but other drugs may cause AGEP, such as paracetamol, oral antifungals and hydroxychloroquine. AGEP usually develops 1 to 5 days after starting the medication. However, it can take as long as 11 days after exposure to the medication. Other causes of AGEP may include vaccinations and viral infections. ",
        "What does acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis look like?": "AGEP starts on the face or on the inner elbows, behind knees, armpits, groin and neck, before rapidly spreading to other areas of the skin. The rash begins within hours or up to 11 days after starting a medication with areas of the skin becoming red and swollen with small (less than 5 mm) whitish, yellow pus-filled spots that burn and itch. Individuals with AGEP may feel unwell and have a fever. ",
        "How is acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis diagnosed?": "AGEP is diagnosed clinically. In some cases, a blood test, skin swab, sample of the skin (biopsy) and patch testing may be needed to diagnose AGEP. ",
        "How is acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. AGEP usually gets better when the medication causing the reaction is stopped. Treatment of AGEP aims to relieve symptoms, and may include moisturisers, topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines and analgesics until the rash resolves. Systemic treatment, such as oral prednisolone is rarely indicated. Most individuals with AGEP can be managed at home. Those who are older or more severely affected may be admitted to hospital for a few days. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis?": "The rash of AGEP usually peels off and resolves within 15 days of stopping the medication.

        "Seborrhoeic Keratoses": "Also known as … Age Warts, Senile Warts, Brown Warts Seborrhoeic Keratoses are benign “wart-like” growths on the skin. Seborrhoeic Keratoses affect all racial groups and most commonly appear after the age of 40 years although some people may develop them earlier. They are often considered unsightly in appearance. Seborrhoeic Keratoses are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the skin. The exact cause of Seborrhoeic Keratoses is unknown although they do tend to occur more frequently with increasing age.  Their appearance is thought to be part of the normal ageing process of the skin. Seborrhoeic Keratoses are “wart-like” growths. They are usually raised above the surface of the skin and appear to be stuck on like “barnacles”. They can occur in varying shades of brown from light to very dark brown. The surface of Seborrhoeic Keratoses usually feels rough and warty. They can sometimes be dry and scaly and become itchy or irritated. Most people will have more than one Seborrhoeic Keratosis and some people may have hundreds scattered over the body. They can appear anywhere on the body including the scalp, face and genitals. In a condition called Dermatosis Papulosis Nigra hundreds of small Seborrhoeic Keratoses are present on the face and neck. Sometimes they are flat and pale and can resemble freckles. Sometimes they can be large (up to many centimetres in size) and may resemble skin tumours. They often appear quite suddenly. In rare cases the sudden development of widespread, multiple (hundreds) Seborrhoeic Keratoses may be associated with an underlying malignant tumour. The diagnosis of a Seborrhoeic Keratosis is usually made by clinical examination. Very dark lesions which have changed in some way or which are growing rapidly may need a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and exclude the possibility of skin cancer. Darker lesions that look irregular should be checked by a doctor to ensure that they are not melanoma. This condition do not need any specific treatment. Usually Seborrhoeic Keratoses are treated for cosmetic reasons or because they have become itchy or irritated. People affected with Seborrhoeic Keratoses often complain that they “catch” on things, bleed or become inflamed, especially if they are large and warty. Seborrhoeic Keratoses are usually treated by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy). They can also be removed surgically by lightly scraping (shave excision or curretage) or burning the lesions (electrocautery).  Laser resurfacing (ablative laser) and strong medical-grade chemical peels may also be used. All methods of removal have an increased risk of permanent colour change (lightening or darkening) or scarring of the skin. Removing them will not prevent new lesions from developing in the future. There is no known effective prevention of these lesions. Seborrhoeic Keratoses do not cause any major health problems. Some people affected by this condition may be troubled by the cosmetic appearance of the lesions. Lesions can be traumatised accidentally by scratching and may bleed or become itchy or inflamed.

        "Who gets ageing skin?": "Intrinsic ageing affects everyone and normally begins in mid-20s. Extrinsic ageing affects people who have had excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ageing prematurely can also affect smokers and those who have had significant exposure to other environmental pollutants. ",
        "What causes ageing skin?": "Intrinsic ageing As an individual ages, collagen production begins to slow, and elastin has a bit less spring. The production of oils and natural moisturizing factors reduces leading to dryness. Dead skin cells do not shed as quickly, and the turnover of new skin cells decreases; the skin becomes thinner and provides less support to its blood vessels. These changes usually begin in a person’s mid-20s, but the signs of intrinsic ageing are often not visible for some time. Environmental factors can also contribute to intrinsic ageing. Extrinsic ageing Extrinsic ageing may be caused by several factors that age the skin prematurely.  These may include: There are also several skin conditions that may occur more frequently in older age, but not directly related to aging.

        "How is ageing skin treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs, and may include: Other general measures that can prevent the skin from becoming more damaged, include: It is also important that individuals regularly perform self-examinations of their whole body, including scalp, hands and feet so that they are familiar with their skin, and look for changes in new and existing moles and spots. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of ageing skin?": "Ageing is a complex process involving intrinsic and extrinsic factors. It is a normal process that happens to everyone. Minimising or avoiding UV exposure by using sun protection measures can reduce extrinsic ageing. Sun protection measures include the wearing of sun protective clothing, correct use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen, wearing of a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.

        "Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD)": "Also known as … Contact Dermatitis or Contact Allergy What is allergic contact dermatitis? Dermatitis is a very common itchy red skin rash with a variety of types and causes (some types are also called eczema). It is common for a person with dermatitis to have more than one type, either at the same time, or at different times in their lives. Contact dermatitis arises from a chemical in contact with the skin which may cause either irritant or allergic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis refers to dermatitis caused by a specific immune reaction to a chemical in contact with the skin. All forms of dermatitis are caused by particular immune system attacks on the skin. The word “allergy” refers to a highly specific immune system attack against an allergen (a specific chemical). This means the immune system targets only that chemical or a very close relative of that chemical. “Contact allergy” refers to the reaction against the chemical that occurs on contact with the skin (when the chemical touches the skin). When the allergic reaction occurs soon (minutes) after contact and causes welts and redness, it is called “contact urticaria”. When the reaction is delayed hours to a day or so after contact, it is called “allergic contact dermatitis” or ACD. There are many chemicals capable of causing ACD and around 100 that are common culprits. Even if there has been long-term contact with a chemical without any problems, it is still possible to develop contact dermatitis to the chemical. Areas of the body where the rash appears depend on where the chemicals come into contact with the skin.  For instance: ACD usually needs more prolonged contact with the chemical to cause the rash. Australian coins contain nickel but usually we do not hold them long enough to cause a rash, even when a person is allergic to nickel. On the other hand, some plants can cause ACD simply by brushing past them (e.g. some grevilleas). There is a broad range of possible causes of ACD including medications applied to the skin, cosmetics, hair dyes, textile dyes, plastic chemicals, rubber and glues, plants and many more. Dermatitis varies from a mild dry red slightly itchy and quite localised rash to a severe weeping or blistering (fluid filled bubbles) rash and can be very widespread. Any part of the skin can be affected. ACD occurs at the point of contact of the offending chemical (allergen) and tends to appear slowly, starting hours to a day after contact. It may also spread beyond the contact area. Once contact with the allergen stops, the rash takes days to a few weeks to improve. If contact is prolonged, the dermatitis may also cause thick scaly skin. The pattern of the rash and the specific history of exposure to items containing the particular allergen give your doctor clues to the likely cause. For instance if the rash is worse during the working week and less on weekends or holidays, a work-related cause may be suspected. People allergic to one chemical are more prone, or more likely to be allergic to others. This could be due to the chemicals being close relatives of each other. It is also common for people with ACD to be allergic to more than one (sometimes many) unrelated chemicals. This may be due to exposure to many potentially allergic chemicals or because their immune system is somehow tuned to react more readily to them. Immediate reactions (e.g. contact urticaria) can be identified by prick tests performed by allergists or some dermatologists, or by blood tests. ACD is not identified by prick tests or blood tests as it is a delayed reaction to chemicals. This requires patch testing performed over 4 to 7 days. This involves applying sticky patches which hold small amounts of chemicals onto the skin (usually the back) for 2 days after which he results are interpreted 2 to 5 days later. Some dermatologists and allergists test with a small number of allergens whereas specialised clinics have access to a larger range of allergens. Interpreting the test results is complex. Be aware there are tests claiming to be allergy tests which have no scientific basis. Treatment of ACD requires identifying the allergens and then avoiding exposure. This requires patch testing and knowing where the allergens are likely to be found. The rash should slowly clear once exposure is avoided. As people often have more than one type of dermatitis at the same time, avoiding allergens may only address one part of the problem. Steroid (anti-inflammatory) creams or steroid tablets will temporarily settle most cases of ACD. The ability of the immune system to cause ACD lasts decades to a lifetime, similar to vaccinations. People prone to developing allergies may develop new ones over time.

        "Alopecia Areata": "Alopecia Areata is an autoimmune disease characterised by non-scarring hair loss in single or multiple areas of the scalp, face or body. It is quite a common condition and about one person in 50 will experience an episode of Alopecia Areata. The scalp is most commonly affected. There are no symptoms associated with the hair loss and the scalp skin looks normal. New hair eventually grows back but it can take many months. Very rarely, Alopecia Areata can become much more extensive. In alopecia totalis there is complete loss of all scalp hair, whilst in alopecia universalis there is complete loss of hair everywhere (eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, underarm and pubic hair). Fortunately, most people affected with Alopecia Areata experience only small patches of temporary hair loss. The condition is not life threatening and does not cause pain but the cosmetic effects can be significant and there are often repeated episodes. Alopecia Areata is believed to be due to a genetic predisposition and an environmental trigger. This causes an immune attack on hair follicles, in particular the follicles with pigment. In some people, acute stressful episodes, or anxiety attacks, have been implicated as an initiating cause. The area of alopecia is usually smooth, or may contain some unaffected white hairs, or hairs broken off close to the surface called “exclamation hairs”. The condition is non-scarring and therefore follicular openings remain undamaged. Other than the visible hair loss, Alopecia Areata is usually symptomless.  Some people describe itch or a burning sensation. Nail abnormalities, most commonly a very fine pitting, can also be observed. The hair pull test can indicate active disease (hair is pulled at the edge of hairless patches and if more than 6 hairs are pulled out, it is considered to be positive). Conditions that occur at a higher rate than normal in people with Alopecia Areata include atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, thyroid disease, pernicious anemia and Down’s syndrome. Usually the diagnosis of Alopecia Areata is based on clinical findings alone. If there is doubt about the diagnosis, a scalp biopsy, hair plucking and skin scraping may be performed to rule out tinea or a blood test may be performed to rule out lupus or syphilis. Alopecia Areata cannot be cured or prevented. However, a wide variety of treatment options is available. Topical treatment options include topical steroids, latanoprost/bimatoprost and topical minodoxil (usually used in conjunction with topical or intralesional corticosteroids). Intralesional corticosteroid injections may be more effective because the disease is actually quite deep below the skin surface on the scalp. For more extensive disease topical anthralin or dithranol cream, diphencyprone topical immunotherapy and ultra violet (UV) phototherapy have been used. Systemic therapies, not routinely recommended, include oral corticosteroids and immmunosuppressive medications (such as cyclosporin, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and azathioprine). Many people with patchy alopecia areata are not actively treated, as there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution or recovery. Psychosocial support may be beneficial in people with coexisting psychological issues. However, for people with extensive areas of hair loss there is much less likelihood of regrowth and often no viable treatment options.  The best advice is often to accept the changes and consider ongoing psychosocial support.  Many women affected with alopecia areata consider wearing a wig whilst men may shave their scalp. Factors that can indicate a poor prognosis for alopecia areata are large extent hair loss at presentation and a pattern of hair loss shaped like a wave around the circumference of the head called “ophiasis”. The longer the duration of hair loss, the younger the age of onset, a family history of alopecia areata, the presence of other autoimmune diseases and nail involvement suggest a lesser likelihood that the hair will regrow. The exact prognosis is unpredictable. However, about 50% of affected people will recover within one year. Recurrent episodes of hair loss are likely.

        "What is follicular mucinosis?": "Follicular mucinosis is a rare disorder affecting hair-bearing skin, most commonly on the scalp, head and neck. The name of the condition comes from the accumulation of mucin (jelly-like, semi-liquid material) in the walls of hair follicles. Sometimes the mucin is visible to the naked eye, and the hair follicles are visibly prominent and seem to ooze a clear gelatinous material. Follicular mucinosis can either occur as a primary, benign condition (sometimes referred to as Pinkus follicular mucinosis), or in association with a lymphoma of the skin. Sometimes follicular mucinosis may show up in skin biopsy results for other inflammatory skin diseases. In these cases, it has no particular significance. ",
        "Who gets follicular mucinosis?": "Primary, benign cases of follicular mucinosis are more likely to occur in children, adolescents or young adults, while lymphoma-associated cases are more likely to occur in middle aged or older adults. ",
        "What causes follicular mucinosis?": "Primary, benign cases of follicular mucinosis are generally of unknown cause. In the lymphoma-associated form, the underlying condition is usually cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). The condition represents a direct involvement of the hair follicles by lymphoma cells (folliculotropic mycosis fungoides). Occasionally, other forms of lymphoma (e.g. Hodgkin disease) have also been associated with follicular mucinosis. ",
        "What does follicular mucinosis look like?": "The head and neck are the most commonly affected sites, especially the scalp and eyebrows. In some cases, the skin lesions can be more widespread. There are a number of different clinical appearances. Typically, there are pink papules (small bumps) or plaques (larger raised or thickened areas of skin) with prominent pores which are the hair follicle openings. The mucin (gelatinous clear material) may ooze from these pores, especially if the area is touched or squeezed. There is usually loss of hair in the affected areas, sometimes accompanied by scarring. The skin lesions may be itchy. There are no clear distinguishing features between benign or non-cancerous and lymphoma-associated cases. Benign cases are more likely to occur in younger individuals. There are a small number of skin lesions which are localised to the head and neck. Lymphoma-associated cases are more likely to occur in older individuals. A larger number of lesions occur across multiple body sites. ",
        "How is follicular mucinosis diagnosed?": "A skin biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Even with a skin biopsy, it can be difficult to distinguish between benign cases and lymphoma-associated cases. Once follicular mucinosis is diagnosed, further assessments are needed to exclude the possibility of an underlying lymphoma. This may include a physical examination, blood tests and imaging studies. Ongoing follow-up is also recommended. ",
        "How is follicular mucinosis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Benign follicular mucinosis may be treated using potent topical corticosteroids or intralesional corticosteroid injections. A range of oral medications may also be used including tetracyclines, retinoids and dapsone, antimalarials and corticosteroids.  In resistant cases, superficial x-ray therapy may be used. If an underlying lymphoma is diagnosed, treatment is directed towards the lymphoma. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of follicular mucinosis?": "Many cases of benign follicular mucinosis burn out and resolve over a few months to years, particularly if the skin lesions are few in number and localised. Other cases can be more persistent, particularly if the skin lesions are more widespread. There can be permanent bald patches if scarring has occurred. If there is an underlying lymphoma, the prognosis is less favourable. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Fabry Disease": "Also known as … Angiokeratoma Corporis Diffusum, Alpha-galactosidase A Deficiency, Anderson-Fabry Disease. Fabry disease is a rare genetic condition, belonging to a group of diseases called lysosomal storage diseases. Fabry disease is an x-linked genetic condition. This means it can be passed on from the mother only. Men are more severely affected; women may have minor symptoms or no symptoms at all. The disease is caused by a genetic mutation or mistake in the encoding of an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A (AGA).  This results in reduced production of the enzyme which this in turn leads to accumulation of a fat molecule (globotriaosylceramide) in various tissues throughout the body. Multiple angiokeratomas are present on the skin in most affected individuals. These are small dark red or purple lesions scattered on the trunk and limbs, predominantly in a “bathing-suit” distribution. The inside of the mouth is sometimes affected. Angiokeratomas first appear at puberty and can increase in size and number with age. They are harmless and painless.  Men with Fabry disease may also have dry skin with decreased sweating and poor exercise tolerance. Fabry disease can affect many organs of the body and manifestations vary between individuals. The most commonly affected organs include the kidneys and heart. Other affected organs include the gastrointestinal tract, brain and peripheral nervous system and eyes. The skin manifestations can offer a clue to the diagnosis of Fabry disease. However, the diagnosis is generally made from a blood test which measures blood AGA enzyme levels. A urine sample may also be required. Skin biopsies show distinctive findings but are not usually required. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, multiple other tests may be required to determine the type and extent of internal organ involvement. Genetic testing can be performed on the affected person and other female relatives. Prenatal diagnosis is available for subsequent pregnancies. This tests the foetus to see if it has the same genetic mutation. Disease monitoring and treatment are performed at specialist centres. Treatment options depend on the type and severity of internal organ involvement. Enzyme replacement therapy is available for some affected individuals through the Life Saving Drugs Program. Angiokeratomas do not require treatment except for cosmetic purposes. They respond well to treatments with vascular laser or electrocautery.

        "Amyloidosis": "Also known as … Cutaneous Amyloidosis Amyloidosis is a group of conditions characterised by the deposition of amyloid protein in organ systems. About 18 different types of amyloid protein have been identified. There are three main types of amyloidosis: In localised cutaneous amyloidosis, the amyloid protein is produced by the skin cells and the protein accumulates only in the skin. Amyloid protein can also accumulate in internal organs. When the amyloid affects more than one body organ or system, it is referred to as systemic amyloidosis. In macular amyloid, the skin does not appear or feel thickened. However, it may show increased pigmentation and the affected area is often itchy. Sometimes the skin does become thickened and this is referred to as popular amyloid. Lichen amyloidosis is the most common form of localised skin amyloid. In this type, there are raised, persistent, individual very itchy lumps and groups of lumps (plaques) most commonly on the fronts of the legs or forearms. These areas are often pigmented. Nodular amyloid is much less common. The biopsy findings are different. The amyloid proteins deposited in the skin do not come from the skin cells. This form may progress to systemic amyloid. A medical history and skin examination may suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous amyloidosis. A skin biopsy is then taken to test for the amyloid protein and exclude other skin problems that may resemble cutaneous amyloid. The aim of treatment is to break the itch-scratch-itch cycle. General measures are recommended to reduce itchiness of the skin. These include: Specific treatments include: Persistent treatment is needed as cutaneous amyloidosis often fluctuates in severity and is quite persistent. Skin irritation and itchiness is often recurrent so repeat treatment may be required.

        "What is androgenetic alopecia (in men)?": "Androgenetic alopecia (in men) is the term used to describe a common form of baldness in men that is slowly progressive and usually inherited. ",
        "Who gets androgenetic alopecia (in men)?": "Androgenetic alopecia (in men) can affect men of any age group after puberty. Approximately 50% of men show signs of cosmetically apparent baldness by the age of 50.1 ",
        "What causes androgenetic alopecia (in men)?": "Most affected men have a genetic predisposition to the condition that could be inherited from either or both parents. Genes such as the androgen receptor gene have been reported to be linked to the condition.2 At the scalp level, hair follicles tend to react and shrink with time under the influence of normal levels of male hormone. This does not imply any underlying hormonal abnormalities. However, men who take anabolic steroid supplements may find that this accelerates the progression of their baldness. ",
        "What does androgenetic alopecia (in men) look like?": "The pattern of baldness is easily recognisable. It usually begins with recession of the hairline at the temples and front of the scalp. This slowly advances further backwards. The hairs on the top of the scalp also become sparser. With time, the areas of baldness join. The whole scalp may be completely bald except for the back of the scalp (occipital scalp) which is usually protected from the balding process. In Asian men, the pattern is sometimes less pronounced and hair loss can present in a more diffuse pattern. ",
        "How is androgenetic alopecia (in men) diagnosed?": "This is an easily recognisable condition that can be diagnosed clinically. ",
        "How is androgenetic alopecia (in men) treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to slow or stop the progression of hair loss and then try to stimulate some hair regrowth. Treatment may include: Hair regeneration therapies, such as platelet-rich plasma injections and autologous scalp tissue micrografting are being increasingly used. However, the efficacy of these treatments varies between individuals with androgenetic alopecia (in men). Hair tonics and nutritional supplements are of very limited benefit. Caps and hats also provide sun protection to the scalp, as well as camouflaging hair loss. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of androgenetic alopecia (in men)?": "Androgenetic alopecia (in men) is mainly a cosmetic condition. It can cause significant psychological and social stress for some affected men. This form of hair loss is a normal process of ageing in genetically predisposed men. Without treatment, the condition is likely to progress gradually. Most men come to terms with the condition with time, without the need for treatment. Hair on the scalp provides protection against ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure. Men with androgenetic alopecia (in men) may be more likely to develop skin cancer or solar keratoses on their scalp without sun protection. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "What causes female pattern hair loss?": "Most women with FPHL have a genetic predisposition to this condition that could be inherited from either or both parents. However, some women with FPHL do not have any paternal or maternal family history of baldness. At the scalp level, hair follicles are more sensitive to the effects of androgen hormones that are required to drive this condition. This does not imply any underlying hormonal abnormalities. In fact, the vast majority of women with FPHL have normal hormonal profiles. Routine hormonal testing is not required but may be recommended by your doctor if you have other signs of androgen excess such as acne, irregular periods, excessive body hair, etc. FPHL is not caused by changes to your diet, infections or hair styling practices. ",
        "What does female pattern hair loss look like?": "FPHL presents as generalised thinning of hair and widening of the scalp parting. Some affected women also experience thinning at the frontal hairline or temples. There may be an increase in hair shedding. These changes usually lead to a reduction of the hair volume that may be evident by a shrinking hair ponytail. Some women get episodic bursts of accelerated hair shedding for a few months in between longer stable periods of little activity. ",
        "How is female pattern hair loss diagnosed?": "FPHL is usually diagnosed clinically. In some cases, a biopsy may be required to rule out other hair loss conditions that can mimic FPHL. ",
        "How is female pattern hair loss treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The main aim of FPHL treatment is to slow or halt the progression of hair loss. The secondary aim is to try and stimulate some hair regrowth. However, this may not happen for all individuals. Treatment options may include: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of female pattern hair loss?": "On long-term or indefinite medical treatments, progression of FPHL can be slowed and hair regrowth is a realistic expectation of treatment for some women.

        "Telangiectases": "Also known as … Spider Veins, Angioectasias, Broken Blood Vessels or Capillaries What are telangiectases? Telangiectases are superficial blood vessels, which are visible with the naked eye. The majority can be improved with laser treatment or sclerotherapy. They are caused by dilated blood vessels under the surface of the skin or in mucous membranes. These spots may occur spontaneously or as a result of various underlying medical conditions or procedures (see list below). They are small, blanchable red spots between 0.5 to 1mm in diameter, which are visible to the naked eye. They occur on various parts of the body or mucous membranes depending on the underlying cause. The most commonly affected areas are the nose, cheeks, chin and legs. They often occur in isolation and are not associated with primary cutaneous disorders. Some secondary causes include: Physical associated telangiectases as a result of: Blood vessels secondary to primary condition in: Conditions associated with telangiectases include: Investigations are not always necessary as telangiectases are diagnosed from their typical appearance. However, if an underlying medical cause is suspected the dermatologist will determine if further investigations such as skin biopsies, imaging or blood tests are needed. Treatment is necessary only if the lesions cause symptoms or if they are a cosmetic concern. Specific treatments include: Colour matched makeup is an excellent method of covering up redness associated with telangiectases. Green-tinted foundations and creams are especially helpful in concealing redness. Laser therapy is an effective method for treating facial telangiectases. The correct types of lasers are readily available in many dermatologist practices. Lunchtime procedures can be organised depending on the extent of the area being treated. IPL can be very effective in treating small to medium-sized facial telangiectases. Larger telangiectases respond better to longer wavelength lasers. Fine needle hyfrector may be used but there are more side effects than with laser therapy. They are harmless and the vast majority of cases are not associated with an underlying medical condition. Laser treatment, when performed by a dermatologist, often removes these spots safely and effectively.

        "Angiofibroma": "Also known as … Fibrous Papule of the face, Fibrous Papule of the nose, Adenoma Sebaceum What is an Angiofibroma? Angiofibromas are benign small skin coloured lesions (usually less than 5mm in size). Under the microscope, they are made up of dilated blood vessels, fibroblasts and collagen (cells and supporting material of the skin). They usually occur alone on the face and are called solitary angiofibroma or fibrous papule of the face. Less commonly, there may be multiple angiofibromas around the nose, cheeks and chin. This cluster of angiofibromas was previously called adenoma sebaceum. Multiple angiofibromas may sometimes be associated with a genetic condition called tuberous sclerosis complex . Angiofibromas can also present as pearly penile papules on the penis or periungual fibromas around the nails (also known as Koenen’s tumour). Angiofibromas are a result of overgrowth of dilated blood vessels, fibroblasts and collagen in a localised area. What triggers this is not well understood. They are small firm, smooth, skin-coloured, pink to red dome shaped raised spots on the skin. Angiofibromas generally range from 1-5mm. There are no other problems associated with a single angiofibroma. Multiple angiofibromas may sometimes be associated with rare genetic conditions including tuberous sclerosis complex and multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1. Angiofibromas are diagnosed by your doctor based on their appearance. Your doctor may use a special tool called a dermoscope to have a closer look. In cases where the lesion needs to be differentiated from other similar looking skin lesions, your doctor may decide to perform a biopsy (take a sample of the skin) and send it to a pathologist who will examine it under the microscope. Angiofibromas do not require any treatment but if their appearance is of concern, there are a number of options that can be considered on an individual basis. These include: Angiofibromas tend to persist without change. This information has been written by Dr Anousha Yazdabadi Updated April 2018 Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Angular Cheilitis": "Also known as … Perlèche or Angular Stomatitis Angular Cheilitis is an inflammation of the corners of the mouth, often bilateral (it often affects both corners of the mouth). The condition presents with redness and irritation. Angular cheilitis is more common in the elderly due to the occlusion from an overhanging upper lip. This causes pronounced skin folds and leads to constant moistening and subsequent irritation from saliva. Other causes can include a receding jawline and poorly fitting dentures that can lead to secondary bacterial and candida infection. Other causes include: Affected individuals have painful cracks or fissures, redness, moisture and occlusion at corners of the mouth.

        "What are aphthous ulcers?": "Aphthous ulcers are common ulcers of the oral mucosa, and present as a painful sore on oral or genital mucous membranes. They can be classified as simple, complex or non-sexually acquired genital ulceration (NSGU). ",
        "Who gets aphthous ulcers?": "Aphthous ulcers are common. They affect between 5% and 25% of the Australian population, and are more common in adolescents and men. 1 Individuals living in high socioeconomic areas are more likely to develop aphthous ulcers. ",
        "What causes aphthous ulcers?": "The exact cause of aphthous ulcers is unknown. Approximately 40% of individuals who get aphthous ulcers have a family history of aphthous ulcers. 2 A weakened immune may also play a role in the development of aphthous ulcers. Some other factors that trigger an outbreak of aphthous ulcers may include: ",
        "What do aphthous ulcers look like?": "Aphthous ulcers are often round, shallow and painful with a creamy-white or grey film and red halo. They occur predominantly in the skin inside the mouth but can also occur in the genital areas. Individuals may experience a single or multiple ulcers. Aphthous ulcers are classified into three categories: ",
        "How are aphthous ulcers diagnosed?": "Aphthous ulcers are usually diagnosed clinically. Complex aphthous ulcers may require blood tests including: A biopsy is rarely required, but is necessary if the ulcer does not heal within 3 to 4 weeks. A swab of the ulcer is also essential to evaluate the presence of a viral, bacterial or candida infection. ",

        "What is athlete's foot?": "Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection affecting the skin on the feet, usually between the toes. The same fungus can also spread to the hands and toenails. The term athlete’s foot comes from the fact that the infection is commonly seen in athletes, such as runners, who shower often and have damp shoes and socks. ",
        "Who gets athlete's foot?": "Athlete’s foot is more common in men and people over 60 years old. Individuals with a weakened immune system or diabetes are more likely to develop athlete’s foot, particularly those who have a cut or open sore on their feet. ",
        "What causes athlete's foot?": "Athlete’s foot occurs when the foot comes into contact with a fungus, generally from the group of fungi called dermatophytes. This can happen if the foot directly touches the fungus, either from another infected individual or a surface that has been contaminated. The fungi thrive in warm, moist environments such as locker rooms and gym showers. They feed off keratin, a protein that makes up our skin, hair and nails. ",
        "What does athlete's foot look like?": "In athlete’s foot, the skin between the toes and feet is usually scaling, peeling and cracked. The skin can also have a whitish and soft appearance. In some cases, blisters can form, and ulcers can appear. Individuals with athlete’s foot often experience itching. A burning and stinging sensation can also occur. Some individuals can have an allergic reaction to the fungus, causing blistering of the hands or feet. Severe complications can form, such as: Figure 1. Athlete’s foot on toes Figure 2. Athlete’s foot on sole of foot ",
        "How is athlete's foot diagnosed?": "Athlete’s foot is usually diagnosed clinically. In some cases, investigations may be needed to identify the specific infection causing the athlete’s foot, such as a skin scrape test (i.e., potassium hydroxide skin test). ",
        "How is athlete's foot treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs, and should begin with general measures including: Athlete’s foot can be treated with over-the-counter antifungal creams, such as: Prescription topical and oral treatments may also be used, including: At-home treatments, such as soaking feet in salt water or diluted vinegar or applying tea tree oil to the skin infection, may be recommended. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of athlete's foot?": "Athlete’s foot will generally improve and clear up if appropriately treated. However, this can vary depending on the severity of the disease. The fungal infection can resolve quickly, but in some cases it can last for a long time. Occasionally long-term treatment may be needed to prevent the infection from reoccurring.

        "What is atopic dermatitis?": "Atopic dermatitis is a common condition where the skin becomes red, dry, swollen and very itchy. The itchiness may interfere with sleep. The inflammation and itchiness wax and wane in severity. In infants, atopic dermatitis often affects the cheeks, scalp, outsides of the arms and legs and the trunk. In children and adults, the inflammation involves the creases in the front of the arms and behind the knee, and the wrists, ankles and buttocks. ",
        "Who gets atopic dermatitis?": "Atopic dermatitis usually begins in infancy or early childhood but can also begin in young adults or even later in life. Atopic dermatitis can exist with other allergic reactions, such as asthma, hay fever and food allergies. Individuals with the genetic tendency to develop allergic reactions (i.e., hay fever, asthma, allergic conjunctivitis) or who have family members who do, are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis. ",
        "What causes atopic dermatitis?": "While atopic dermatitis may be caused by both genetic and environmental influences, there is no known single factor that causes the skin to become itchy and inflamed. Individuals with atopic dermatitis often have relatives with eczema or sensitive skin, asthma, hay fever, food allergies or allergic conjunctivitis. Hereditary factors predispose an individual to having dry skin and a skin barrier that is less able to keep out environmental irritants and allergens. It also predisposes an individual to producing immune antibodies to bacteria, such as staphylococcal aureus and other allergens. ",
        "What does atopic dermatitis look like?": "The appearance varies with the age of the affected individual.  However, itching, scratching (often breaking the skin with scratching) and rubbing are present in all cases of atopic dermatitis.

        "What causes atopic eruption of pregnancy?": "“Atopy” describes a problem with the immune system that causes individuals to be prone to eczema, asthma or hay-fever. It often runs in families. “Atopy” is also associated with poor skin barrier function, causing dry and sensitive skin. Women with AEP may have had eczema (atopic dermatitis) before pregnancy, or they may develop a rash for the first time during pregnancy. ",
        "What does atopic eruption of pregnancy look like?": "AEP develops relatively early in pregnancy. There are two forms of this condition: The skin is usually dry. Scratch-marks (excoriations) or weeping (exudation) of the skin may be present. The rash is very itchy. ",
        "How is atopic eruption of pregnancy diagnosed?": "AEP is usually diagnosed from a physical examination of the skin. A skin biopsy may be performed. Blood tests may also be undertaken to see if there is an elevation of IgE, an immunoglobulin that is associated with atopy. ",
        "How is atopic eruption of pregnancy treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. AEP can usually be controlled with moisturisers and steroid ointments. Soaps and other irritants should be avoided, and washing should be limited to once daily. More severely affected women may benefit from phototherapy (narrow band UVB). In some cases, steroid tablets may be required. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of atopic eruption of pregnancy?": "AEP does not adversely affect the pregnancy or cause any harm to the baby. However, the child may be prone to developing eczema, asthma or hay fever.

        "Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis": "Also known as … Atopic Winter Feet, Forefoot Dermatitis, Moon-boot Foot Syndrome, Sweaty Sock Dermatitis What is Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis? Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis is a skin condition where there is cracking and peeling of the weight-bearing areas of the soles. The condition occurs primarily (but not exclusively) in children who have atopic dermatitis (eczema), asthma or hay fever. Their skin seems more sensitive than the skin of others and friction appears to play a role. Boys aged 3 to 14are most commonly affected. This condition tends to be better in winter when shoes and socks are being worn, deteriorating in summer due to increased friction with the foot moving more in sandals, particularly if sweaty. Wearing socks and shoes made of synthetic material can exacerbate the condition. The soles become shiny and glazed with some scaling, painful cracks and fissures. Sometimes the heel and palms are affected as well. The tops of the feet, the web spaces between the toes and the instep are typically spared. A diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on a medical history and the appearance of the rash. However, investigations such as skin scrapings or patch tests may be needed to distinguish it from other skin conditions (such as psoriasis, keratolysis exfoliativa, contact allergic dermatitis or fungal infection). Prognosis is good as the condition usually resolves by puberty.

        "What is atypical mycobacterial infection?": "Infectious organisms known as Atypical Mycobacteria (ATM) cause common skin infections seen in Australia. Mycobacteria have a thick waxy coat surrounding their cell walls to protect them in harsh environments. Individuals can get ATM infections from various environmental sources such as soil, water (e.g., swimming pools, aquariums, spas and ponds), food products and common animals (domestic and wild). Mycobacteria are highly resistant to medications due to their thick protective cell wall. They are also highly resistant to drying and can survive outside the body without moisture for a long time. Mycobacterium ulcerans (M.ulcerans), a common type of ATM, can cause Buruli ulcer. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causing tuberculosis in the lung, and Mycobacterium leprae, causing leprosy, are also mycobacteria that can result in more serious infections. ",
        "Who gets atypical mycobacterial infection?": "ATM can affect individuals of any age, but young children, and those with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable. Individuals with medical equipment inside them and those who have recently undergone surgical or non-surgical procedures are also at higher risk. ",
        "What causes atypical mycobacterial infection?": "A group of infectious organisms causes ATM infections. There are different species, such as Mycobacterium marinum, and Mycobacterium chelonae. ",
        "What does atypical mycobacterial infection look like?": "The clinical appearance of an ATM infection varies, depending on the infecting ATM. An initial sign of an ATM infection is skin lesions at the infection’s entry site.  Some individuals may have thickened lumps or plaques causing no symptoms, usually growing slowly. Some of these lumps can become ulcers, such as Buruli ulcers. ",
        "How is atypical mycobacterial infection diagnosed?": "Along with clinical suspicious, diagnosis usually involves taking a sample of the skin lesions, known as a biopsy. Culturing the tissue from the biopsy helps grow the bacteria. Special tests like polymerase chain reaction identify the presence of the ATM’s genetic material. This will help determine the specific bacteria causing the skin infection. ",
        "How is atypical mycobacterial infection treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The individuals’ immune status, as well as the severity of the ATM infection, the specific bacteria and antibiotic sensitivity are important factors to consider. Medical therapy consists of antibiotics, which are used in combination with each other. Antibiotics may include rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Individuals may require surgical therapy along with medical therapy such as drainage of abscesses and removal of foreign bodies. The condition may be more challenging to treat if individuals are undernourished, have HIV or are on medications that weaken their immune system. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of atypical mycobacterial infection?": "Although ATM infections are challenging to treat, it is important to note that these are low-grade infections that are curable with treatment. However, knowing the specific bacteria is essential before starting treatment. Individuals may undergo prolonged treatment for 6-12 months or even longer. They may often require consultations with infectious disease specialists. An individuals’ response to treatment also influences the outcome.  Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Pseudofolliculitis Barbae": "Also known as…Razor Bumps, Shave Bumps, Barber’s Itch, Folliculitis Barbae Traumatica What is Pseudofolliculitis Barbae? Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is a chronic inflammation of hair-bearing areas of the skin caused by ingrown hairs that develop after shaving or plucking. This condition is more often seen in individuals with curly hair on the beard area and nape of the neck. Newly cut or shaved hair, especially when coarse and curly, tends to curl back and the sharp point penetrates the skin and causes a foreign-body reaction in the skin.  The hair shaft itself may have some structural weakness. This weakness in the hair may be inherited/passed down through families (i.e. genetic hair shaft weakness). This can contribute to the development of Pseudofolliculitis Barbae. Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is most commonly seen in the beard area of men of African background who have short, coarse and curly hair and who shave regularly. The condition may also be seen (though it is far less common) on other parts of the body that are shaved. Multiple red, skin coloured or brown lumps centred around the hair follicle are seen on the beard area (cheeks, chin and front of neck) and back (nape) of the neck. Sideburns and the moustache are normally not affected. As the condition progresses, larger lumps may develop and complications such as keloid scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may occur. Formal tests are not required to reach a diagnosis.  The dermatologist would need to distinguish this condition from a bacterial or fungal infection of the hair follicles. The best treatment is to allow the hair to grow out. Changing shaving practices will improve the condition: Chemical hair removers such as depilatory creams have been used but may cause irritation to the surrounding skin. If inflammation occurs, it can be successfully treated with certain steroid creams. A variety of alternative treatments are available such as steroid injections (intralesional steroids) and topical eflornithine hydrochloride. Laser hair removal and electrolysis may be used in cases that are not responsive to simple measures. Complications such as scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can be treated if necessary. Relapses occur frequently unless shaving practices are addressed and changed.

        "What is basal cell carcinoma?": "Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. BCC accounts for more than three-quarters (75%) of all skin cancers. 1 Most basal cell carcinomas are slow-growing and almost never spread to other parts of the body. However, if they are left untreated, they can damage or destroy the skin and surrounding tissues and cause an ulcer known as a rodent ulcer. ",
        "Who gets basal cell carcinoma?": "Individuals who are at a greater risk of developing a basal cell carcinoma include those with fair skin, with a strong family history of BCC, and with a Celtic background. ",
        "What causes basal cell carcinoma?": "There are many factors that lead to the development of most cancers however sun exposure is by far the most important factor in the development of BCCs. This excessive sun exposure usually occurred many years before the BCC develops. ",
        "What does basal cell carcinoma look like?": "BCCs usually start with a subtle change on the skin, often a small bump or a flat red patch.  BCCs develop very slowly over months and years, steadily becoming larger and more obvious. Eventually they may appear as a non-healing sore. BCCs are often not noticed until relatively well developed and their appearance can be confused with that of a naevus (mole), patch of dermatitis or a scar. A lesion that bleeds on the face is quite suspicious of BCC. Superficial BCCs are confined to the very top layers of the skin so are often more easily treated with topical and non-surgical techniques. They can however become relatively broad in size. Superficial BCCs are especially common on the trunk. This type of BCC usually appears as a rounded lump on the skin. They are less likely to have invisible extension under the surface of the skin than other types of BCC. These are the most troublesome type of BCC as they are usually larger than they appear to the naked eye. They are usually the most difficult to see and are often not detected until well advanced. It is therefore not uncommon for this type to be inadvertently incompletely removed with treatment, allowing the BCC to continue to grow and recur. Morphoeic and micronodular are different types of infiltrating BCCs. Figure 1. BCC on the lip. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Chris Kearney Figure 2. BCC on the nose. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Chris Kearney Figure 3. BCC on the nose. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Chris Kearney Figure 4. BCC on the cheek. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Chris Kearney ",
        "How is basal cell carcinoma diagnosed?": "BCC is diagnosed clinically by the presence of a slowly enlarging skin lesion typical appearance. Usually a biopsy (a small sample of the lesion) is taken and sent to the pathology laboratory to be examined under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis. ",
        "How is basal cell carcinoma treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs, and may include: This involves spraying the tumour with liquid nitrogen (-196°c) including a small rim of surrounding skin. The freeze time is prolonged and multiple freeze thaw-cycles may be used, as determined by the treating doctor. This method is mainly used to treat superficial BCCs. This involves cutting out the lesion with a safety margin and suturing (stitching) the skin back together. This technique was developed especially for BCCs found on the face where it is important to remove them with a very high cure rate as well as minimise the amount of skin removed in order to achieve the best possible cosmetic outcome. It involves surgical excision (removal) of the lesion with a narrow margin, testing of the pathology while the person waits, ensuring no BCC is left behind, before suturing (stitching) the wound. Curettage and cautery involve injection of local anaesthetic, followed by scraping the lesion from the skin surface with a curette and then cauterisation (heat-sealing with a hot wire) of the base. It typically heals with a pale scar a little wider than the lesion that was treated. It is often used for superficial BCCs on the trunk and limbs. This involves application of a sensitising cream followed by exposure to a special red light. It has a lower chance of scar formation than other treatments; however, it is only appropriate for certain superficial and low-grade lesions. Topical immunotherapy involves application of a special cream. The cream stimulates the body’s own immune system to fight and destroy the skin cancer cells.  Typically, the area will become moderately inflamed during the period of treatment.  It is only appropriate for certain superficial and low-grade lesions. Radiotherapy is occasionally used if other treatments are not possible.  In the case of an advanced BCC, radiotherapy is sometimes used after, and in addition to, surgical excision (removal). ",
        "What is the likely outcome of basal cell carcinoma?": "Fortunately, BCC is usually the least dangerous and almost always completely curable by treatment. It is extremely rare for a BCC to spread to other parts of the body however they will relentlessly enlarge and destroy nearby tissue if not treated.  They have an affinity for nerves, and some can spread along a nearby nerve, making them much more difficult to cure. After having a single BCC there is, on average, a 50% chance of developing another BCC at some stage of a person’s life. 2 The general recommendation from dermatologists after removing a BCC is to undergo skin-checks every 6 to 12 months.  It is important that the skin be self-examined, and any suspicious new lesions reported.

        "What does Becker’s naevus look like?": "Becker’s naevus starts as a large area of more pigmented, but otherwise normal skin. It is mostly seen on the trunk, particularly the shoulder or chest, but can also be seen on the legs or arms. After puberty, there is an increased growth of hair that slowly becomes thicker and darker. In some cases, the pigmentation change is absent and only the hairs are seen. The skin may feel thicker if the deeper skin muscle fibres are present in greater than normal amounts. ",
        "How is Becker’s naevus diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made clinically. In some cases, a biopsy may be required to differentiate a Becker’s naevus from a café au lait macule which is usually present at birth or develops within the first year of life. ",
        "How is Becker’s naevus treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. While there is no effective treatment for the majority of Becker’s naevus, there are some treatment options available to minimise the appearance and treat complications including: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of Becker’s naevus?": "Although an instance of Becker’s naevus cannot be removed entirely, the cosmetic appearance can be improved. There is currently no evidence that Becker’s naevus can become malignant. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Jessner Lymphocytic Infiltrate": "Also known as … Benign Lymphocytic Infiltration of the skin, Jessner–Kanof Lymphocytic infiltration of the skin What is Jessner Lymphocytic Infiltrate? It is a benign skin condition characterised by persistent lymphocyte (immune) cells in the skin. It may be a variant of lupus erythematosus, but this remains uncertain.  The cause of this condition is unknown. Jessner’s occurs primarily on sun-exposed sites such as the head, neck and upper back. It appears as one or several non-scaly red raised spots, plaques and less commonly larger lumps. Circular lesions with a central clearing are commonly seen. Lesions do not usually cause symptoms, but some affected people experience burning or itching. Individuals are otherwise well and have no internal symptoms. Onset or worsening of lesions following sun exposure commonly occurs. There can be a seasonal variation in severity. As Jessner’s can improve on its own, treatment is often unnecessary. Sun avoidance and sun protection are strongly recommended in all cases, regardless of whether there is a history of photo-aggravation. A variety of treatment options have been tried with variable success rates including: The course of Jessner’s is variable and unpredictable, most often lasting months to years. Lesions may recur at the same site or elsewhere. There are often periods of remission and exacerbation. However, the condition may also resolve completely without treatment.

        "What is blastomycosis?": "Blastomycosis is a rare fungal infection caused by breathing in microscopic particles (spores) of the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis (B. dermatitidis). ",
        "Who gets blastomycosis?": "Blastomycosis is not usually found in Australia. Humans as well as animals, such as dogs can develop blastomycosis. Originally it was thought to be found only in North America, but cases have been reported from many countries in the world, including some parts of Africa and Madagascar. It occurs mostly in males who do outdoor activities and is more common in individuals with weakened immune systems. ",
        "What causes blastomycosis?": "Blastomycosis is caused by breathing in microscopic particles(spores) of the fungus B. dermatitidis which is found in rotting wood, or moist soil with rotting wood and leaves. ",
        "What does blastomycosis look like?": "The spores of B. dermatitidis can lodge in the lungs and cause an acute as well as a chronic pneumonia. Infected individuals may initially have flu-like symptoms. Later fever and shortness of breath may develop. Pulmonary symptoms can occur. In 20-40% of cases the infection spreads to other parts of the body – the skin, bones, kidneys, reproductive organs, urinary tract, liver, spleen and central nervous system. 1 Common sites of cutaneous lesions of blastomycosis are face, neck, scalp, and upper limbs. These may look elevated, crusted, warty, plaque-like, or ulcer-like and can vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. Early lesions can also appear as papules or pustules.  Chronic lesions appear as warty plaques. Rarely cutaneous lesions can be secondary to spread from an underlying bony lesion. Cutaneous lesions of blastomycosis can gradually increase in size if left untreated. ",
        "How is blastomycosis diagnosed?": "The best way to diagnose the infection is to perform a fungal culture. A history of visiting an endemic area for blastomycosis and a prior history of blastomycosis of the lungs would give important clues to the diagnosis. It may also be diagnosed by examining a small sample of infected tissue under the microscope. An antigen test may detect the presence of the fungus in a urine or serum sample. ",
        "How is blastomycosis treated?": "Some cases of blastomycosis improve spontaneously. Skin lesions of blastomycosis usually indicates systemic spread, as such it is best to treat the condition with systemic antifungals. Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs, and may include itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole or amphotericin B. Relapses may occur, particularly in those with weakened immune systems. Voriconazole and posaconazole can be considered in recalcitrant cases or where other drugs are not tolerated. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of blastomycosis?": "Cutaneous lesions may cause scarring if treatment is delayed. Most individuals with mild lung infections recover without any specific treatment. Symptomatic patients recover fully with treatment.  Immunocompromised individuals need to be monitored to detect relapses of the disease. Tyring SK, Lupi Omar, Hengge UR.

        "Who gets Bowen’s disease?": "Risk factors for Bowen’s disease include: ",
        "What causes Bowen’s disease?": "The vast majority of lesions are caused due to UV exposure. UV damages the DNA, resulting in uncontrolled growth of the skin cells. HPV is another major cause of Bowen’s disease. ",
        "What does Bowen’s disease look like?": "Bowen’s disease frequently looks like a persistent red scaly patch that slowly grows over time. It most commonly appears on areas highly exposed to sunlight such as the face, neck, chest, arms and legs. Bowen’s disease can also occur on areas such as the lips, inside the mouth and the genital area. In these cases, it may look like an ulcer or thickened scar. Bowen’s disease often causes no symptoms and hence there is delay in seeking treatment. It may be mistaken for other conditions such as dermatitis (eczema), or psoriasis, fungal infection (tinea), seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichenoid keratosis or porokeratosis. Figure 1.

        "Brachioradial Pruritus": "Also known as … Brachioradial Itch Brachioradial Pruritus is a skin condition where the affected person is troubled by abnormal skin sensations on the outer forearms, upper arms and occasionally on the top of the shoulder.  The affected person may describe the sensations as itching, burning, prickling or stinging. Any changes seen in the skin usually result from chronic rubbing and scratching at the affected area. The skin may become thickened and pigmented. There may be breaks in the skin and nodules due to scratching. The affected areas frequently show changes resulting from chronic sun damage. The condition is due to inflammation in nerve fibres within the affected area of skin.  The inflammation results most commonly from damage to the sensory nerves in the skin caused by chronic sun exposure. Occasionally the nerves are compressed and damaged by changes in the cervical spine as a result of arthritis or age related changes. The symptoms are often worse after sun exposure and the affected person may report fewer problems or no symptoms in the winter or autumn. Brachioradial pruritus is diagnosed by taking a medical history and examining the skin. If the history suggests that spinal abnormities may be the cause, medical imaging such as CT scan and MRI may be needed. The majority of cases in Australia are related to sun exposure. Some cases resolve within a few weeks to months with topical measures and sun protection. Some individuals have waxing and waning symptoms with episodic flare-ups of the abnormal sensations followed by periods when they have no problems. This information has been written by Dr Davin S.

        "Telangiectases": "Also known as … Spider Veins, Angioectasias, Broken Blood Vessels or Capillaries What are telangiectases? Telangiectases are superficial blood vessels, which are visible with the naked eye. The majority can be improved with laser treatment or sclerotherapy. They are caused by dilated blood vessels under the surface of the skin or in mucous membranes. These spots may occur spontaneously or as a result of various underlying medical conditions or procedures (see list below). They are small, blanchable red spots between 0.5 to 1mm in diameter, which are visible to the naked eye. They occur on various parts of the body or mucous membranes depending on the underlying cause. The most commonly affected areas are the nose, cheeks, chin and legs. They often occur in isolation and are not associated with primary cutaneous disorders. Some secondary causes include: Physical associated telangiectases as a result of: Blood vessels secondary to primary condition in: Conditions associated with telangiectases include: Investigations are not always necessary as telangiectases are diagnosed from their typical appearance. However, if an underlying medical cause is suspected the dermatologist will determine if further investigations such as skin biopsies, imaging or blood tests are needed. Treatment is necessary only if the lesions cause symptoms or if they are a cosmetic concern. Specific treatments include: Colour matched makeup is an excellent method of covering up redness associated with telangiectases. Green-tinted foundations and creams are especially helpful in concealing redness. Laser therapy is an effective method for treating facial telangiectases. The correct types of lasers are readily available in many dermatologist practices. Lunchtime procedures can be organised depending on the extent of the area being treated. IPL can be very effective in treating small to medium-sized facial telangiectases. Larger telangiectases respond better to longer wavelength lasers. Fine needle hyfrector may be used but there are more side effects than with laser therapy. They are harmless and the vast majority of cases are not associated with an underlying medical condition. Laser treatment, when performed by a dermatologist, often removes these spots safely and effectively.

        "What is bullous pemphigoid?": "Bullous pemphigoid is a skin condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the skin and causes blisters to form. The term “bullous” refers to these blisters and “pemphigoid” comes from the Greek word pemphix and means bubbles. Bullous pemphigoid is the most common type of autoimmune blistering disease. ",
        "Who gets bullous pemphigoid?": "Bullous pemphigoid can occur at any age, but it is more common in individuals over 70 years of age. In rare cases, bullous pemphigoid has been reported in infants and children. Individuals with bullous pemphigoid are about five times more likely to have a neurological disease such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease and cerebrovascular disease. 1 Other things that are linked to bullous pemphigoid include malignancy, psoriasis and diabetes mellitus. ",
        "What causes bullous pemphigoid?": "There are two main layers of the skin, the top layer is called the epidermis and the deeper layer is the dermis. The area between these layers is known as the basement membrane zone. In bullous pemphigoid, the body’s immune system produces proteins (autoantibodies) which attack and damage specific proteins in the basement membrane zone (known as BP180 and BP230). These proteins are critical in attaching the top layer of skin cells (the epidermis) to the underlying layer (the dermis). In bullous pemphigoid, the basement membrane proteins are damaged, which causes the layers of the skin to separate, leading to blister formation. What causes the immune attack on the skin is unknown. Bullous pemphigoid sometimes occurs after an infection or, in a few cases, it occurs after taking new medications. Medications with the strongest associations include gliptins, checkpoint inhibitors, loop diuretics, and penicillins. ",
        "What does bullous pemphigoid look like?": "Bullous pemphigoid can initially look like dermatitis or urticaria (hives) with red itchy bumps and patches. Unlike hives, these patches do not move around or disappear. The condition may stay like this for months until blisters eventually start to form. The blisters are typically large, tense, fluid filled and very itchy.  They occur most frequently on the skin of the body folds and trunk. Usually, the condition does not affect inside the mouth.

Image reproduced with permission of Prof. Dedee Murrell ",
        "How is bullous pemphigoid diagnosed?": "Because there usually are no blisters initially, diagnosing bullous pemphigoid may be delayed. The following tests are usually required: The Bullous Pemphigoid Area Index (BPDAI) is used to determine the severity of an individual’s bullous pemphigoid and best treatment. It also helps assess the severity and activity of the disease and can track the disease over time. Autoimmune Bullous Disease Quality of Life (ABQOL) is another tool used to measure how much the disease is impacting an individual’s daily life. ",
        "How is bullous pemphigoid treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Bullous pemphigoid treatment aims to reduce blister formation, relieve pruritus (itchiness), promote wound healing and minimise the side effects of treatment. Treatment options may include: Avoiding triggers When a drug cause is suspected, the suspected drug culprit should be discontinued where feasible. Mild Disease More aggressive disease Oral medications, such as: Refractory disease (resistant to treatment) ",
        "What is the likely outcome of bullous pemphigoid?": "Bullous pemphigoid is usually a chronic disease that may have recurrent flares over many years.

        "What causes café-au-lait macules?": "There are no known causes for CALMs, except when associated with genetic conditions such as McCune-Albright syndrome or neurofibromatosis. ",
        "What do café-au-lait macules look like?": "CALMs contain more melanin (pigment) than normal skin. They are uniform, tan to dark brown flat spots that may be located anywhere on the body except the mucous membranes. They can range from a few mm to greater than 20 cm in diameter. They enlarge proportionately with overall body growth but remain stable in size during adulthood. ",
        "How are café-au-lait macules diagnosed?": "CALMs are diagnosed clinically and based on the appearance of the macules. If there are multiple CALMs present, further testing to exclude an underlying genetic condition may be needed.  In more complex genetic conditions, having six or more CALMs larger than 5 mm in diameter before puberty, or larger than 15 mm after puberty may be an important clinical feature. ",
        "How are café-au-lait macules treated?": "There is no medical treatment required for CALMs. However, CALMs may be treated for cosmetic reasons with pigment-specific lasers, including: Results are variable and recurrences are common. Surgical excision can also be performed in cosmetically acceptable cases. When CALMs are associated with neurofibromatosis or another underlying condition, monitoring and referral to a specialist is required. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of café-au-lait macules?": "CALMs continue to persist without treatment. Individuals who respond well to initial treatment often have low recurrence rates. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

However, calciphylaxis is not exclusive to ESRF individuals on dialysis, and can also occur in kidney transplant recipients and rarely in individuals with normal kidney function. ",
        "What causes calciphylaxis?": "While the cause of calciphylaxis remains unknown, it is thought to be due to reduced blood flow in the small arteries (arterioles), due to abnormal calcium deposition (calcification) in a circumferential fashion, most commonly in the intima and internal elastic lamina (the two innermost layers of the arteriole). Other causes that may trigger the development of calciphylaxis, include: ",
        "What does calciphylaxis look like?": "The appearance of calciphylaxis depends on the time of presentation. Areas most affected are the lower limbs and abdomen, especially fatty areas such as the thighs and buttocks. In the early stages, calciphylaxis usually starts as dusky purple-pink, painful (tender), plaque like lesions under the skin (subcutaneous nodules), representing areas of diminished blood supply (ischemia). An early cardinal sign is pain out of proportion to clinical findings. These early subcutaneous plaques and nodules can progress to deeper concavities (ulcers) with black overlying tissue (dry gangrene). In advanced stages, dead tissue (necrotic eschar) from inadequate blood supply (infarction) predominates. Early changes can give a mottled appearance on the skin similar to another condition known as livedo reticularis. Calciphylaxis can also involve the upper extremities, with lesions on the fingers occurring in some individuals. ",
        "How is calciphylaxis diagnosed?": "Calciphylaxis is usually diagnosed clinically. A skin biopsy – deep telescoping punch or excisional biopsy to capture the subcutis – from the lesion margin may aid or confirm diagnosis. There are no specific blood tests for calciphylaxis. In some individuals, increases in phosphate, calcium, calcium x phosphate product or parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels may be observed, although these are not always present. An X-ray of the affected body area may show evidence of vascular calcification within the skin.  Bone scintigraphy and non-contrast CT may also identify areas dense in vascular calcification. ",
        "How is calciphylaxis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. It will often involve a multi-faceted approach to target the cause and improve outcomes. Expert wound care, monitoring for secondary infection, optimal pain relief (analgesia), and meticulous attention to minimise repetitive tissue trauma is universal. Cessation of medication predisposing to calciphylaxis is recommended, if possible. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate may be used (this helps to remove the deposited calcium). Individuals with renal failure may need some adjustments in their medication to control abnormal calcium and/or phosphate levels. In some individuals, oxygen therapy (hyperbaric oxygen or high-flow oxygen therapy) as part of a multi-faceted approach may demonstrate benefit. Some individuals may also benefit from surgical removal of any damaged tissue. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of calciphylaxis?": "The mortality rate of patients with calciphylaxis and end stage renal failure is reported to be between 60%-80%, and often a result of secondary infection and sepsis.1 Combined distal and proximal involvement, along with penile involvement, portends a worse prognosis.

It usually manifests as small or large patches of cayenne pepper coloured spots and pigmentation. The skin rash is usually found on the lower limbs but may also involve the trunk.  The cause of pigmented purpuric dermatosis is currently unknown. Several risk factors have been implicated including venous disease, capillary fragility, certain drugs and allergy to certain food colourings and dyes. Basic science and clinical research is currently underway to investigate the cause of this condition and explore effective treatments. There are several different forms of pigmented purpuric dermatosis but all these forms share some common features. The key feature is the cayenne pepper coloured spots that can join up to create larger patches. The cayenne pepper spots indicate fresh lesions. The spots are fixed and do not disappear with pressure. Spots or larger patches of brown pigmentation indicate older lesions. Except for one form PPD is usually not itchy and not painful. The diagnosis is usually made by the dermatologist examining the individual. A skin biopsy will confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of pigmented purpuric dermatosis depends on the underlying condition. Treatment of the underlying venous disease will improve the rash but will not result in complete resolution. Any medication that is found to be the cause should be stopped. Specialised blood tests and even allergy testing may be required to find the cause.

It is permanent and its area will increase in proportion to general body growth. Port-wine stain should not be confused with other pink patches present at birth such as the stork bite mark. The stork bite mark (angel’s kiss, salmon patch) on the central forehead is very common and will usually go away by itself in the first or second year of life. Port-wine stain is in the family of disorders known as vascular malformations. These are not the same as the far more common infantile haemangioma (strawberry birthmark) which is in the family of benign vascular tumours. Infantile haemangiomas are not usually present at birth. They have an early growth phase, become raised, and eventually shrink and disappear. Our understanding of the condition remains limited. The birthmark is thought to be due to a disturbance in the behaviour of blood vessels. The nerve control of blood flow is deficient and this results in blood flow being at maximum all the time. The capillaries within the port-wine stain remain wide open and this produces the typical red appearance. Normal skin will become red, for example, after sunburn, as a result of increased blood flow into the area. However, once the burn heals the blood vessels reduce to normal flow and the redness disappears. This normal behaviour cannot occur in a port-wine stain. Recently an abnormality in the GNAQ gene has been discovered in port-wine stain areas. However, this will need further corroborative studies. Port-wine stain is not hereditary. At birth, the port-wine stain is typically pink to red.  Although it is most commonly seen on the face, it can be present on any part of the body.  In some cases the port-wine stain will thicken and become darker in colour later in adult life. The thickening can be in the form of small dark lumps or the whole stain may thicken. Port-wine stain can be associated with certain syndromes. However, it is important to understand that the port-wine stain does not cause the syndrome but is simply a symptom of the condition. The diagnosis is usually obvious from the appearance of the stain and a history of presence at birth without further disproportionate growth. Further investigations will be required if an associated syndrome is suspected. Port-wine stain can be treated with laser. The specific laser used depends on whether the stain is in the flat pink stage or the bluish thickened appearance that sometimes develops in older adults. Treatment of flat pink childhood port-wine stain Treatment is recommended, particularly if the port-wine stain involves the face as it can be associated with teasing at school.  Treatment is best commenced as early possible as multiple treatment sessions are necessary. If a general anaesthetic is needed, this risk needs to be considered. There is a trend to commence treatment as soon as possible after birth. Treatment is initially given at intervals of between 2 to 4 weeks. Under the age of about 4 months this can be done without general anesthetic as the treatment is not particularly painful. As children become older, treatment generally requires general anesthetic. Treatment of adult-type thicker darker lesions Thicker lesions may be more resistant to treatment. They require more deeply penetrating laser and light systems. Depending on availability and preference, these systems include long pulsed Alexandrite laser, long pulsed Nd: YAG laser and some IPL systems. Safety of laser treatment Treatment of childhood port-wine stains has a very high safety profile with the use of modern lasers that have skin cooling. There are very rare instances of minor blistering and scarring. The more deeply penetrating lasers, as used in adult stains, carry a slightly higher risk of minor scarring.

        "What is cellulite?": "Cellulite is a very common condition. It is the skin dimpling and lumpiness on the skin surface of the thighs, buttocks and abdomen and is seen in up to 90% of women in various degrees.1 ",
        "Who gets cellulite?": "Cellulite is seen in nearly all women and rarely occurs in men. It does not usually appear until puberty or later in life. Other contributing factors include: ",
        "What causes cellulite?": "Cellulite is not really a “disease” and is not related to any internal medical conditions. Cellulite does not usually cause any worrisome symptoms or problems other than the undesired appearance of the skin. The exact cause of the appearance of cellulite is uncertain but it is believed to be the result of three different physical factors: The female hormone oestrogen is thought to contribute to the distribution of fat that causes the appearance of cellulite. ",
        "What does cellulite look like?": "Cellulite typically presents as dimpled, uneven and slightly lumpy skin over the buttocks, thighs and other areas. Figure 1. Cellulite on the thigh. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Adrian Lim Figure 2. Cellulite on the right hip. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Adrian Lim ",
        "How is cellulite diagnosed?": "Cellulite is usually diagnosed clinically without the need for further testing. ",
        "How is cellulite treated?": "The condition remains difficult to treat with few studies demonstrating impressive, long-standing results despite the “commercial hype” of advertised products. Since cellulite is not strictly related to excess body fat, losing weight through dieting and/or exercise may not always resolve the problem. Most topical creams that promise to remove cellulite do not deliver on their claimed effects. Many natural botanical products claim to reduce the appearance of cellulite but there is limited evidence that they have any effect. For example, topical creams containing caffeine, vitamin A derivatives (Retinols and Retinoids), and aminophylline are well advertised. However, there is very weak evidence regarding the success of these creams and most have a minimal impact on the cellulite, even with regular long-term use. Similarly, various dietary supplements such as gingko balboa, soy lecithin, bioflavinoids, evening primrose oil have been promoted, without solid clinical studies, to improve cellulite through antioxidant effects, improving micro-circulation or fat metabolism. Physical treatments such as massage, injection of temporary fillers and various light and laser devices can, in some cases, reduce the appearance of cellulite. Ultrasonic, acoustic wave and radiofrequency devices can also improve the appearance of cellulite.  However, these anti-cellulite devices require multiple treatment sessions that can be expensive, and long-lasting results are not guaranteed. Surgical techniques such as liposuction and subcision can be considered but these procedures are not always successful and, in some cases, may make the condition worse. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of cellulite?": "Cellulite causes no physical harm but may be a cause of embarrassment for the individual. However, there is no single highly effective cure for cellulite. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "What is central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is a chronic and progressive type of scarring alopecia that results in permanent hair loss. CCCA most commonly starts in the centre of the scalp and, without treatment, expands over time causing an irreversible area of baldness. ",
        "Who gets central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "CCCA is most commonly seen in middle-aged African women. ",
        "What causes central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "The cause of CCCA is unknown, but it is likely that genetic factors and several hair care practices may cause CCCA, such as: Mutations in PAD13 gene, which encodes a hair protein has been associated with CCCA.1 ",
        "What does central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia look like?": "CCCA only affects the scalp. The bald patch starts in the central part of the scalp (vertex or crown) and gradually expands outwards symmetrically (centrifugal). It may progress slowly (over decades) or rapidly (over years) resulting in patches of permanent hair loss (baldness). There is often a bald patch with shiny skin (scarring) seen in the centre of the scalp. Traction alopecia (loss of hair in areas of high tension) or hair breakage is also a feature. Individuals with CCCA may also experience tenderness, pain, tingling, burning, “pins and needles” or itching of the scalp.  In some cases, crusts, pimples and scale may also be present and the scalp may feel soft or ‘boggy’ when touched. However, sometimes there are no symptoms other than an area of hair loss present. ",
        "How is central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia diagnosed?": "Early diagnosis is important so that treatment can be started to prevent further permanent hair loss. CCCA is diagnosed clinically. A skin biopsy of the affected area of scalp should be taken to understand the presence of inflammatory cells around the hair follicles, loss of the sebaceous glands (oil glands) and premature damage of the hair follicle. Skin scrapings and swabs may also be required if scale, crust and/or pimples are present to exclude the possibility of fungal or bacterial infections. ",
        "How is central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to improve symptoms and stop further hair loss. Treatment of CCCA involves changing haircare practices and avoiding: Anti-inflammatory agents may also be used such as: Cosmetic camouflage (e.g. wigs) and hair transplantation may be an option for individuals who have significant bald patches seen in the advanced stages of CCCA. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "Without early treatment, CCCA is likely to progress over years eventually causing severe, non-reversible scarring and permanent hair loss (bald patches).

        "Granulomatous Cheilitis": "Also known as … Cheilitis Granulomatosa, Miescher’s Cheilitis Granulomatous Cheilitis is a rare condition characterised by persistent, diffuse, soft-to-firm swelling of one or both lips. The exact cause is unknown. However, factors including allergy to foods and medication, contact allergy, genetic predisposition and infection have been implicated. The first symptom of the condition is often an intermittent and usually painless swelling. As it progresses, the episodes become more frequent and may involve both lips. There may be painful cracks, fissures, reddish brown discoloration and scaling. In rare cases, granulomatous cheilitis has been reported with facial nerve palsy and fissured tongue resulting in a condition known as Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome. A lip biopsy of the affected tissue is needed in most cases.  However, a biopsy may not be conclusive in the earlier stages. It is important to rule out other associated diseases including Crohn disease, sarcoidosis, foreign body reaction, lymphoma, angioedema and infection. The aim of treatment is to improve the person’s appearance and comfort. Spontaneous remission is possible, although rare. Symptoms may be improved by avoiding potential allergens which can be identified through patch testing. It is also important to effectively treat any underlying conditions.

        "What causes childhood bullous pemphigoid?": "Like adult bullous pemphigoid, childhood bullous pemphigoid occurs when cells of the body’s immune system produce proteins (autoantibodies) which attack and damage specific proteins of the basement membrane zone (known as BP180 and BP230). These proteins are critical in attaching the top layer of skin cells (the epidermis) to the underlying layer (the dermis). If the basement membrane proteins are damaged the top and bottom layers of the skin break apart causing blister formation. The cause of the immune attack on the child’s skin is unknown. ",
        "What does childhood bullous pemphigoid look like?": "Similar to adult bullous pemphigoid, childhood bullous pemphigoid is characterised by tense fluid-filled blisters accompanied by redness and itching. There may also be patches of itchy redness without blisters before the onset of blisters. The eruption may occur anywhere on the child’s body.

Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic pustular condition affecting the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet. It may occur with psoriasis or without any other skin disease. The cause of PPP is not completely understood. PPP affects the eccrine sweat glands which are most common on the palms and soles. It may be autoimmune in origin. Genetic factors are important as several members of some families may be affected. PPP presents as crops of itchy or sore pustules on the palms and/or soles. PPP can occur on one or both hands and/or feet. Scaly red patches may also be seen in association with the pustules. In the more chronic stages of the disease, the skin can be dry and thickened with deep fissures (cracks in the skin). There is usually a sharp demarcation between the normal and affected skin areas. PPP varies in severity and may persist for many years. The discomfort can be considerable, interfering with work and affecting quality of life. A form of PPP which affects the tips of the fingers is called acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau or acropustulosis. It can lead to destruction of the fingernail on affected digits. Certain conditions have been reported to occur in individuals with PPP: In most cases, the diagnosis is made by clinical examination. In rare cases, a biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Skin scrapings can exclude fungal infections that may mimic PPP.  Skin swabs may be taken to exclude a bacterial infection but will be negative in uncomplicated PPP. Treatment of PPP can be difficult. The condition can also respond poorly to therapy. Less severe cases can usually be managed with topical treatments. More severe cases may require physical or systemic therapy.

The proteins produced from these genes instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialised functions (differentiate). The NRAS or BRAF gene mutations responsible for giant CMN are somatic, meaning that they are acquired after conception. A somatic mutation in one copy of the NRAS or BRAF gene is sufficient to cause CMN. These mutations occur early in embryonic development during the growth and division (proliferation) of cells that develop into melanocytes. The overactive protein may contribute to the development of giant CMN by allowing cells that develop into melanocytes to grow and divide uncontrollably, starting before birth. ",
        "What do congenital melanocytic naevi look like?": "Compared to common moles, CMN are often larger and more raised above the skin. Many are different shades of brown and black, and some are hairy. ",
        "How are congenital melanocytic naevi diagnosed?": "CMN is usually diagnosed from a clinical examination of the skin. In some cases, a biopsy may be needed. Risk of developing melanoma with congenital melanocytic naevi There are certain characteristics that may make an individual with CMN more likely to develop melanoma. The risk of melanoma is mainly related to the size of the CMN (i.e., large or giant size). ",
        "How are congenital melanocytic naevi treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The method for managing a CMN will depend on the individuals age, the size of the lesion, its location and depth and the risk of malignancy emerging within the lesion. Giant or large lesions The primary reason for surgery in a giant or large CMN is if a melanoma develops within it. Infants with giant or large CMN are usually managed by a multidisciplinary team and have regular follow-up by a dermatologist because of the increased risk of complications. Complete surgical excisions may reduce the risk of melanomas. However, this is associated with complications, and total removal may be impractical for giant or large lesions. Small lesions Unless the small CMN is changing, it is often not necessary for it to be surgically removed. Some reasons why an individual may choose to have the small CMN surgically removed, include unsightly appearance, difficulty in observing the mole (i.e., on back), change in lesion (i.e., colour darkening) or melanoma-like appearance. Neurocutaneous melanocytosis Individuals with symptoms suggestive, or at high risk, of neurocutaneous melanocytosis should undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect the disease. Those at high risk should have an MRI in the first 6 months of life. Other treatment options Other treatment options may include dermabrasion, tangential (shave) excision, chemical peels and laser ablation. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of congenital melanocytic naevi?": "CMN usually grow as the child grows. Some may become lighter with time. However, they generally persist for life. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

It can either occur in isolation or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where the internal organs or joints may be involved. There are four main subtypes of CLE. In some cases, there may be overlap between the different forms of CLE present. The most common forms of isolated CLE are SCLE and DLE. These subtypes will remain the focus of this information. ",
        "Who gets cutaneous lupus erythematosus?": "CLE is more common in females and amongst certain racial groups. It is not hereditary or contagious. ",
        "What causes cutaneous lupus erythematosus?": "CLE is thought to be an “autoimmune” condition where specific antibodies are produced and cause damage to the skin resulting in the appearance of a rash. The exact cause is unknown. However, genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role, and sunlight, hormonal factors and certain medications may trigger or exacerbate the condition. ",
        "What does cutaneous lupus erythematosus look like?": "The appearance of CLE varies greatly depending on the subtype. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) ",
        "How is cutaneous lupus erythematosus diagnosed?": "A skin biopsy is usually required for routine histopathology (viewing under microscope) and immunofluorescence (specific stains) to confirm diagnosis of CLE. Blood tests are also usually taken to look for markers of inflammation and autoantibodies (such as ANA and dsDNA), the latter often being negative in CLE. ",
        "How is cutaneous lupus erythematosus treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. There is no cure for CLE. The main goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and the appearance of the rash, as well as prevent long-term complications such as scarring and hair loss. General measures are important in the treatment of all forms of CLE, and may include: Topical treatments for CLE may include topical steroids and non-steroid based anti-inflammatory ointments (e.g., pimecrolimus or tacrolimus). In DLE, local steroid injections may be useful in selected cases. Systemic medications (oral or injections) may also be needed to treat CLE, such as: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of cutaneous lupus erythematosus?": "SCLE uncomplicated by systemic disease often has a chronic course with intermittent flare-ups. It often flares during sunnier weather. Sometimes there is spontaneous remission. The skin usually heals without scarring or permanent marks, and  can be managed with treatment. In DLE there may be permanent loss of pigmentation, scarring of the skin and/or hair loss leading to disfigurement and psychological distress. Early successful treatment can reduce the risk of scarring. Very rarely, some chronic severe and untreated DLE skin lesions may turn into skin cancer (such as squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma).

        "What is cutaneous small vessel vasculitis?": "Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) is a condition caused by inflammation of the skin’s blood vessels. It classically presents as areas of red or purple discoloration. This is due to bleeding under the skin and does not disappear when pressure is applied (purpura). ",
        "Who gets cutaneous small vessel vasculitis?": "CSVV occurs in all age groups but is more common in the adult population. Children are more likely to be diagnosed with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), a subtype of CSVV caused by deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) within the blood vessel wall. HSP is often preceded by viral respiratory illness. ",
        "What causes cutaneous small vessel vasculitis?": "CSVV may be caused by a reaction to medications, food and food additives, underlying infection, autoimmune connective tissue disease, malignancy or other diseases. However, in most cases there is no known underlying cause. In a minority of affected individuals, cutaneous vasculitis can be part of a more severe vasculitis affecting other organs in the body known as “systemic vasculitis”. ",
        "What does cutaneous small vessel vasculitis look like?": "The most common presentation of CSVV is raised red-purple spots (purpura, between 0.3-1 cm in diameter) and/or petechiae (purpuric lesions <3 mm in diameter) which do not disappear with pressure (i.e. non-blanching). These lesions can join together, become ulcerated, and may be associated with blood filled blisters. The rash of vasculitis is most common on the lower legs, areas of tight-fitting clothing and areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon). However, any surface can be involved. Individuals affected with CSVV may experience itching, burning or pain or they may not experience any symptoms at all. General symptoms such as fevers, weight loss and muscle aches may occur. Between 5-25% of individuals with CSVV can experience joint, genitourinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. 1 This raises the possibility of internal involvement. In HSP, lesions tend to occur on the buttocks and lower limbs. Children may develop systemic disease with gastrointestinal, joint, and/or kidney involvement. In adults with HSP, arthritis and kidney disease occur more frequently. ",
        "How is cutaneous small vessel vasculitis diagnosed?": "A detailed medical history and physical examination is essential, as well as selected laboratory studies (e.g., blood and urine tests) are essential to look for underlying causes or organ involvement. A skin biopsy is often needed to confirm the diagnosis. Two samples of skin are taken – one for histology (microscopic examination of the skin) and the second for immunofluorescence (to look for antibodies in the vessel walls). ",
        "How is cutaneous small vessel vasculitis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. General measures and symptomatic treatments include: Systemic therapy to arrest the disease process is usually reserved for those individuals who have persistent symptoms or develop skin or systemic complications, and may include: It is important to rule out internal organ involvement and a referral to a physician may be necessary in those with systemic signs or symptoms.  Any identified trigger or cause must also be removed or treated. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis?": "In most individuals, the condition is self-limiting which means that it resolves spontaneously, usually within 2 to 4 weeks. Sometimes the skin inflammation can leave residual darkening of affected areas known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This usually fades slowly over many months.

        "What is cutaneous tuberculosis?": "Cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB) is a skin infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, which mainly causes lung infection, but can involve other organ systems. Most skin tuberculosis (TB) is the result of spread from internal organs to the skin, but occasionally the bacterium can be directly inoculated into the skin. ",
        "Who gets cutaneous tuberculosis?": "Skin manifestations of TB infection are rare, accounting for up to 2% of all TB infections, even in the countries where TB is common. 1, 2 In endemic countries, CTB is more common in children than in adults.2 Some factors that may increase the risk of contracting tuberculosis, include: ",
        "What causes cutaneous tuberculosis?": "Cutaneous tuberculosis is nearly always caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the tubercle bacillus. It may follow: ",
        "What does cutaneous tuberculosis look like?": "The spectrum of clinical manifestations is wide and depends upon: Primary Inoculation Tuberculosis Also known as tuberculous chancre, this occurs through direct exposure with the mycobacterium via an injury that caused a break in the skin. This may include accidental injury, tattooing, piercings, or injections. It is a rare form of CTB occurring in individuals that have not had prior exposure to the mycobacterium. In rare cases children, non-immune individuals amidst high TB prevalence regions or poor living conditions can be affected. Tuberculosis Verrucosa Vutis Presents as a slow growing, painless, warty plaque at the site of inoculation and occurs in individuals that have had previous exposure to the mycobacterium. This form of infection through direct exposure is more common than primary inoculation tuberculosis. Commonly affected sites include the lower legs and buttocks. Lupus Vulgaris Presents as a chronic, slow growing, painless brown-red plaque. Lupus vulgaris (LV) is one of the more common presentations of CTB and occurs as a result of mycobacterium spread from the bloodstream or internal organs in patients with moderate to high immunity. If the individual has developed a fairly high level of immunity to the presence of the bacteria, then the skin lesions seen are often localised and well-defined. Scrofuloderma Presents as painless, ulcerated plaques with fistula or sinus formation and discharge. It is common in endemic areas and occurs over affected lymph nodes, bones or joints. Lesions may spontaneously heal with scarring. Orificial Tuberculosis Occurs in advanced disease with organ involvement and patients with weakened immune systems, where they may develop painful or painless papules, nodules or ulcers in the mouth, nasal passage, and anogenital skin or mucosa. Miliary Tuberculosis For individuals with little immune resistance to the infection, malnourished, have infections such as HIV or on immune suppressive medications, the mycobacterium may spread via the blood stream. Individuals may develop red papules and pustules. It is associated with poorer outcomes. Metastatic Tuberculous Abscess Also occurring in individuals with weakened immune systems, this presents as fluctuant, subcutaneous nodules that may penetrate the skin and form draining sinuses and ulcers. These are usually found on the arms and legs and are due to the spread of the mycobacterium via the bloodstream. Tuberculid Tuberculid is probably best considered as an allergic reaction to parts of mycobacterium tuberculosis in individuals with a high level of immunity to the bacteria. ",
        "How is cutaneous tuberculosis diagnosed?": "The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis is made by tissue (skin biopsy) microscopy, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Other tests may include tuberculin skin test or an interferon gamma release assay blood test. ",
        "How is cutaneous tuberculosis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to: Active cutaneous TB may be treated with anti-tubercular antibiotics (i.e., isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) or surgical excision. Latent TB may be treated to prevent reactivation of TB infection. Drug resistant TB is when M. tuberculosis is resistant to at least one of the first-line anti-TB drugs. Multidrug-resistant TB is when M. tuberculosis is resistant to more than one of the anti-TB drugs, which include at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Drug resistance occurs when anti-TB treatment is not adhered to, or the individual may be infected with a resistant strain per se. It is an emerging problem in CTB. CTB is best managed in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist. Screening of contacts is an essential part of comprehensive management. Screening for co-infections such as leprosy and HIV is recommended. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of cutaneous tuberculosis?": "Some manifestations of cutaneous tuberculosis, such as miliary tuberculosis and metastatic tuberculous abscess, may indicate extensive systemic involvement that can be life-threatening and associated with poorer outcomes. Adequate and appropriately administered multi-drug therapy can be successful. Nevertheless, the resolution of some skin lesions may take time to heal with scarring being a common complication.

        "Who gets Darier’s disease?": "Skin changes typically begin during adolescence. Darier’s disease follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, where the condition is caused by a single gene from one parent. Children with one parent affected have a 50% chance of inheriting the abnormal gene. 1 However, not everyone with the abnormal gene will exhibit clinical features of the disease. ",
        "What causes Darier’s disease?": "Darier’s disease is caused by a gene mutation. While a child of an affected adult can inherit the disorder, it may also be caused by a new mutation without any previous history of family members being affected. ",
        "What does Darier’s disease look like?": "The head and neck are the most commonly affected sites, especially the scalp and eyebrows. In some cases, the skin lesions can be more widespread. There are several different clinical appearances. Typically, there are pink papules (small bumps) or plaques (larger raised or thickened areas of skin) with prominent pores which are the hair follicle openings. The mucin (gelatinous clear material) may ooze from these pores, especially if the area is touched or squeezed. There is usually loss of hair in the affected areas, sometimes accompanied by scarring. The skin lesions may be itchy. There are no clear distinguishing features between benign or non-cancerous and lymphoma-associated cases. Benign cases are more likely to occur in younger individuals. There are a small number of skin lesions which are localised to the head and neck. Lymphoma-associated cases are more likely to occur in older individuals. A larger number of lesions occur across multiple body sites. Figure 1. Jean L. Bolognia, Joseph L. Jorizzo, Julie V. Schaffer 2012 from Basic Principles of Dermatology – Third Edition Figure 2.

        "How is Darier’s disease diagnosed?": "A skin biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. ",
        "How is Darier’s disease treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to relieve symptoms, treat complications such as infection and improve quality of life. The following general measures may be helpful in preventing flare-ups, and include: Treatment may include: Sudden onset of pain or weeping or blisters requires a visit to the local doctor for a swab and then treatment with antibiotics or antiviral medication. Surgical or laser removal may also be appropriate for smaller severely affected areas such as under the armpits. Referral to a geneticist or genetic counseling may be necessary. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of Darier’s disease?": "Many individuals with Darier’s disease present with mild symptoms, and these symptoms may clear up altogether. However, for more severe cases it may involve a chronic relapsing-remitting pattern.

        "Erythema Annulare Centrifugum": "Also known as … Superficial or Deep Gyrate Erythema, Erythema Perstans, Palpable Migrating Erythema What is Erythema Annulare Centrifugum? Erythema Annulare Centrifugum (EAC) refers to an annular (ring-shaped) erythematous (red) skin eruption that tends to spread outwards whilst clearing centrally. The cause of EAC is unknown but it is probably due to a hypersensitivity reaction to a variety of agents including drugs, insect or spider bites, infections (bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal), food ingestion (such as blue cheese), malignancies or some underlying diseases. In most cases no cause will be found for the EAC. Some people with EAC may have no symptoms whilst others experience mild itching associated with the rash. EAC usually begins as a small raised pink-red spot that slowly enlarges forming a ring shape while the central area flattens and clears. There may be an inner rim of scale. Sometimes the lesions do not form complete rings but grow into irregular shapes. As lesions resolve, there is no residual scarring but the skin may temporarily become redder. One or several lesions of EAC may be localised to one area of the body or generalised over many areas. Lesions most often appear on the thighs and legs. They may occur anywhere on the body but typically spare the palms and soles. The diagnosis of EAC is made by clinical examination. Further investigations may be needed to exclude other causes of annular rashes and to look for an underlying cause. In some cases a skin scraping is needed to exclude fungal infections that may mimic EAC. A biopsy of the skin may be needed in some cases. EAC is usually self-limited which means that it usually resolves without treatment. However, eruptions may last from a few weeks to many years. EAC has been known to resolve once the underlying diseases has been treated. The prognosis for EAC is excellent except in rare cases when it is associated with an underlying cancer or disease.

        "Delusions of Parasitosis": "Delusions of Parasitosis is a rare and very distressing psychiatric disorder. The person suffering from the condition truly believes that their skin is infested by parasites (mites, lice or other insects). However, when the skin is examined, no parasites or bugs can be seen in or on the skin. The person will often experience sensations of biting, crawling and stinging related to the false belief or delusion and refuses to believe that the parasites are not there. However, when interacting and talking about other aspects of their life, their behaviour and functionality is completely normal. The psychiatric disorder must be differentiated from other conditions that may lead to abnormal sensations in the skin, (e.g. effects of cocaine or amphetamine addiction or due to a medical cause such as vitamin B12 deficiency). The cause of Delusions of Parasitosis is unknown. Typically, those affected with the condition have consulted many doctors over many months or years, but have never had any success in eradicating the belief that their skin is infested with parasites. Affected people often bring specimens picked from their skin for examination, believing them to be bugs or parts of bugs. However, these specimens are usually scabs or cloth fibres and do not include parasites. Individuals often give extensive descriptions of the bugs’ appearance, habitat, reproductive cycle as well as where these enter and leave their body.  Affected individuals may have had repeated exterminators in their homes and sprayed themselves and their homes with potentially toxic pesticides. The skin changes seen are those that have been caused by scratching, picking and digging into the skin to get the bugs out. They may also have dermatitis related to the various creams, disinfectants and toxic chemicals that have been used repeatedly on their skin, again in the false belief that they are killing the bugs. There may be little to find on the skin which makes it very important to eliminate any other possible cause of the crawling, stinging biting sensations. A dermatologist usually makes the diagnosis from a thorough medical history and careful skin examination plus a microscopic examination of samples brought along by the affected person. The dermatologist must exclude other medical conditions, illicit drug use or psychiatric problems that could be contributing or causing this condition. Blood tests or skin scrapings may be needed to exclude other conditions. Delusions of parasitosis can be very difficult to treat.  The majority of cases require treatment with oral medications known as antipsychotics (most commonly risperidone or olanzapine). The affected person is usually reluctant to seek psychiatric care or to accept a referral to a psychiatrist. A multidisciplinary team approach is needed which involves the dermatologist liaising with the psychiatrist and the GP. The most difficult aspect of treatment is convincing the person suffering from this condition that the infestation is not real and that they need antipsychotic medications. This condition can persist for many years and frequently relapses when treatment is stopped. This information has been written by Dr Sophie Bakis-Petsoglou This page is currently under review.

        "Dermatitis Herpetiformis": "Dermatitis herpetiformis is an uncommon itchy skin condition which can occur at any age. It is a specific skin change seen in coeliac disease. Most people with dermatitis herpetiformis also have the more common bowel problems associated with coeliac disease known as gluten enteropathy. If the bowel is involved, individuals often have symptoms such as bloating, cramping or diarrhoea. Most people with dermatitis herpetiformis have coeliac disease which is an autoimmune condition causing gluten intolerance. The body’s immune system reacts against a certain component of gluten in the diet, causing inflammation of the skin. Itchy pink-red bumps or tiny blisters appear often symmetrically on the outer aspects of elbows, knees, buttocks, scalp or shoulders. The blisters may not be obvious to see, as they are often scratched off. Dermatitis herpetiformis can be mistaken for eczema or scabies.  A skin biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Blood tests are often performed to identify specific autoimmune markers for coeliac disease. Sometimes individuals may be referred to a gastroenterologist for further tests such as an endoscopy, where a biopsy of the small bowel is taken. A skin biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Even with a skin biopsy, it can be difficult to distinguish between benign cases and lymphoma-associated cases. Once follicular mucinosis is diagnosed, further assessments are needed to exclude the possibility of an underlying lymphoma. This may include a physical examination, blood tests and imaging studies. Ongoing follow-up is also recommended. A strict gluten-free diet is strongly advised. This may be the only treatment that is required.

        "What is acne keloidalis nuchae?": "Acne keloidalis nuchae (AKN) is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects hair follicles on the back of the neck. It may occur in combination with other conditions including hidradenitis suppurativa, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, pilonidal sinus and acne conglobata. The term AKN can be confusing because the condition is not acne and the scars formed are not true keloids. ",
        "Who gets acne keloidalis nuchae?": "AKN is mostly seen in men of African-Caribbean background, but it may also be seen in those of Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean backgrounds, and in rare cases, Caucasians. It is 20 times more common in males than in females1. ",
        "What causes acne keloidalis nuchae?": "The cause of AKN is poorly understood. Factors that may cause AKN include: ",
        "What does acne keloidalis nuchae look like?": "In the early stages of the condition, small firm bumps, pimples and crusts form around the hair follicles on the back of the scalp (occipital scalp). These papules can be painful and itchy. As the condition progresses, the bumps become small scars that extend from the back of the neck up to the top of the scalp and then enlarge to become keloid-like masses. In severe cases, irreversible scarring hair loss (alopecia) and/or abscesses with draining pus may occur. Tufted (“doll-like”) hairs may exist; these are multiple hair shafts from one hair follicle opening. Figure 1. Acne keloidalis Nuchae on the back of the neck. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Michelle Rodrigues ",
        "How is acne keloidalis nuchae diagnosed?": "AKN is diagnosed clinically through history and examination by finding bumps, pimples and scars on the scalp. In some cases, a skin sample (biopsy) of the scalp may be required to diagnose AKN and distinguish it from other forms of scarring hair loss that look similar. ",
        "How is acne keloidalis nuchae treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. AKN may often persist despite a variety of treatments. AKN treatment is aimed at preventing scarring and permanent hair loss, and may include: Surgical treatment or radiotherapy of the scarred area may be used for cases that are advanced or treatment resistant. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of acne keloidalis nuchae?": "While there is no cure, AKN can be treated if diagnosed early. It can be difficult to treat once scarring has developed. In severe cases, scarring can occur on affected areas of the scalp, resulting in hair loss. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "What is dermatitis?": "Dermatitis is a general term to describe a group of common conditions presenting as itchy inflammation of the skin. The term eczema is often used interchangeably with dermatitis although theoretically eczema refers to atopic eczema. There are a variety of clinical types and causes. ",
        "Who gets dermatitis?": "Dermatitis can affect anyone at any age, but the risk largely depends on the type of dermatitis. ",
        "What causes dermatitis?": "Dermatitis is inflammation of the skin caused by activation of the immune system. Genetic and environmental factors, such as stress, irritants, allergens, food and medication may play a role. Some individuals may develop more than one type of dermatitis at any given time. ",
        "What does dermatitis look like?": "Acute dermatitis is a rapidly evolving red swollen itchy rash that tends to weep and form blisters. Whereas chronic dermatitis presents as an irritated thickened area of skin that can be red or darker in colour. The intermediate state is called subacute dermatitis. Dermatitis skin can also split or fissure causing pain. Areas of crusting or tender blistering may suggest a bacterial or herpes virus infection complicating dermatitis.

        "Dermatomyositis": "Dermatomyositis is a condition where there is inflammation in skin, muscles and blood vessels. The condition is more common in females. It can affect children usually before the age of 10 years as well as adults usually over the age of 40 years. The cause of dermatomyositis is unknown. The immune system may be triggered abnormally by an infection or cancer. The appearance of dermatomyositis can be quite variable. Muscle involvement is the prominent feature in some cases. In other cases, skin changes occur without or before muscle involvement. Skin involvement commonly shows as a rash around the eyes with swelling of the eyelids and a rash on the knuckles of the hands. There may also be ragged nail cuticles as well as a rash over other joints, on the thighs and the upper chest and back. The main concern with dermatomyositis in adults is the possibility of an underlying cancer that has caused the condition. Up to 30% of adults with dermatomyositis are found to have an underlying cancer. Common associated cancers are from the lung, breast, ovaries, uterus, stomach and rectum. Cancers may be present at the time of diagnosis or may occur later. It is important that affected people have appropriate follow-up and screening. Other problems may include difficulty breathing or swallowing due to muscle weakness. There may also be inflammation and scar tissue in important organs such as the heart and lungs leading to heart and lung failure. Inflammation and blockage in the blood vessels supplying the bowel may cause complications. A rare feature in adults is calcium deposits in the muscles and just below the skin. Childhood cases of dermatomyositis are very rarely associated with cancer. The main concerns are muscle weakness, sensitivity to sunlight and calcium deposits in muscles and under the skin. The condition is usually diagnosed from the appearance of skin as well as a history of muscle weakness or pain. Skin and/or muscle biopsies or muscle MRI, are helpful in confirming the diagnosis. The diagnosis can also be confirmed with blood tests, which show raised muscle enzymes. The affected person needs to be thoroughly evaluated to assess the extent of the condition and involvement of other organs such as lungs, heart and bowel. Further investigations are needed to search for, or exclude, an underlying cancer especially in adults. This involves a general physical examination and radiology tests such a chest X-ray, CT scans, mammograms and ultrasound scans. Further tests such as heart conduction studies (ECG), pap smears and blood tests are also needed to look for underlying problems. Regular follow up and screening, especially in the first three years after diagnosis, is required because of the association with an underlying cancer that may not be present at the time of diagnosis.

        "Who gets dermatosis papulosa nigra?": "DPN is seen most commonly in individuals with skin of colour who are of African, Asian, Indian, or Polynesian background. ",
        "What causes dermatosis papulosa nigra?": "The cause of DPN is unknown but around 50% of those affected have a family history of DPN. 1 It is not contagious and does not spread from person-to-person. ",
        "What does dermatosis papulosa nigra look like?": "Multiple smooth, small, brown-black raised spots appear on the face and neck. Sometimes they also develop on the upper chest or back. The raised spots are actually tiny seborrhoeic keratoses. These spots usually start in young adults and tend to increase in number with age. Women often have more of these spots compared with men. The raised spots can occasionally become irritated if scratched or rubbed but generally they cause no problems other than their appearance. Figure 1. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

        "How is dermatosis papulosa nigra diagnosed?": "DPN is diagnosed clinically by seeing the typical appearance of the raised spots on the skin. In very rare cases, a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. ",
        "How is dermatosis papulosa nigra treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Although DPN is harmless and does not require any form of treatment, various methods for removal are available if desired for cosmetic reasons. Treatment options may include: Various types of lasers or medical-grade chemical peels may also be used. However, these treatments carry a risk of causing colour (pigment) change or scarring of the skin, which may be permanent. Treatment of DPN does not prevent new spots appearing in the future. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of dermatosis papulosa nigra?": "Over time, more spots may appear, but the spots are not infectious or cancerous. Treatment will help remove existing spots but will not prevent new ones from forming. There is no known way of preventing spots from developing.

        "What are digital myxoid cysts?": "A digital myxoid cyst is an entirely benign, non-cancerous swelling that usually occurs at the base of the nail on the fingers or toes. Digital myxoid cysts are not a sign of infection. They do not develop into skin cancer. ",
        "Who get digital myxoid cysts?": "Digital myxoid cysts are usually diagnosed in people over the age of 50 and are associated with osteoarthritis and osteophytes (bone spurs). 1 ",
        "What cause digital myxoid cysts?": "The exact cause is not known. The cyst is frequently connected to the lining of the finger or toenail joint and is usually located between the joint and the nail. Arthritis of the joint at the end of the finger or toe probably predisposes an individual to developing these cysts. ",
        "What do digital myxoid cysts look like?": "Digital myxoid cysts are skin-coloured, reddish or slightly translucent. If a cyst overlies the area where the nail is formed, it may cause a groove to occur along the length of the nail. Sometimes, slightly sticky, clear, straw-coloured or blood-stained contents may leak out of the cyst. Most individuals usually develop only one cyst. However, some individuals may develop more than one cyst on different fingers. The cyst is usually not painful. However, a cyst may become tender, especially when knocked. Occasionally, there may also be symptoms of arthritis with pain, stiffness and deformity of the joint. Cysts may get in the way and their appearance may cause concern. Digital myxoid cysts rarely become infected. ",
        "How are digital myxoid cysts diagnosed?": "A digital myxoid cyst is usually easily recognised as a small lump overlying the end joint of a finger or toe. There may or may not be a groove present in the adjacent fingernail. If the skin over the top of the cyst is broken, a discharge of clear, slightly sticky material from the cyst is characteristic. If the cyst arises under the nail the diagnosis is more difficult. The overlying nail is often deformed. A scan or a biopsy (sample taken from the cyst with a local anaesthetic) may be needed to confirm diagnosis. ",
        "How are digital myxoid cysts treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. If a digital myxoid cyst does not cause any symptoms, no treatment is required. Small cysts can disappear spontaneously without treatment. If treatment is considered necessary, a number of options may be considered, including: Without local anaesthetic With local anaesthetic ",

        "Who gets discoid eczema?": "Discoid eczema can affect individuals across all age groups. It tends to be more prevalent among older adult males and younger adult females. Drug-induced discoid eczema may also arise from medications that induce skin dryness. ",
        "What causes discoid eczema?": "The cause of discoid eczema is unknown. Some individuals have conditions related to eczema such as hay fever or asthma. Dry skin may aggravate or predispose an individual to developing discoid eczema and the rash may be worse in winter. Less commonly, certain medications, or contact with a chemical in the individual’s environment, may play a role. ",
        "What does discoid eczema look like?": "Initially, the coin-shaped areas may be pink and relatively flat with some scaling, but other changes may occur such as thickening of the skin, oozing, crusting and severe itch. As the rash improves, some brownish or pale discolouration may occur which gradually disappears over months. In some cases, the rash may become more widespread. Secondary infection may occur with significant oozing of fluid and crusting. ",

        "Dissecting Cellulitis of the Scalp": "Dissecting Cellulitis of the Scalp is a rare condition in which pus-filled lumps develop on the scalp, resulting in scarring and permanent hair loss over the area affected. The cause is unknown, although it is most likely due to blocked and ruptured hair follicles, resulting in significant inflammation and secondary bacterial infection. The appearance of dissecting cellulitis of the scalp is that of pus-filled lumps and nodules on the scalp with overlying scarring and hair loss. Other conditions related to hair follicle blockage, rupture and inflammation can occur with dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. They are known as the “follicular occlusion tetrad” and include acne conglobata (a severe form of acne), hidradenitis suppurativa (boils and cysts in the body folds) and pilonidal sinus (an infected cyst at the base of the spine). In addition, inflammation of the joints (arthritis) and bones can rarely occur in association with these conditions. The condition can usually be diagnosed by clinical appearance by a dermatologist examining the scalp. Swabs of pus and plucked hairs can be analysed to rule out infections. A scalp biopsy may be required in some cases. This can be a chronic and persistent condition which responds slowly to treatment. Avoid picking and squeezing the lumps as this can worsen the problem. Seek treatment early as this can avoid widespread permanent scarring hair loss. Avoid oil-based hair products and use an antiseptic shampoo regularly. Antiseptic washes (eg chlorhexidine) and shampoos can be useful as well as topical antibiotics such as clindamycin lotion. Long-term courses of oral antibiotics are often used to treat this condition. They are used to reduce inflammation and include medications such as doxycycline, erythromycin or clindamycin. A combination of clindamycin and rifampicin is also commonly used. Dapsone is a medication which can be used for this condition as well. It requires some blood monitoring but is usually well tolerated. Steroid tablets (eg prednisolone) can be used for short term management of significant inflammation of the scalp. Steroids can also be injected into localised sites of disease activity. Retinoid tablets (eg isotretinoin) which are most commonly prescribed for severe acne may be used to treat dissecting cellulitis of the scalp as well. A combination of treatments may be needed to treat the condition aggressively in order to avoid long term scarring hair loss. Large cysts and abscesses can be incised and drained or excised. Skin grafting may be required in some cases. Wigs and hairpieces are available and can be subsidised for medical causes of hair loss. This is a chronic condition which can have a relapsing course. The condition can resolve spontaneously but this can take months or years and result in significant scarring and permanent hair loss.

        "What are drug eruptions and reactions?": "Drug reactions are unwanted and unexpected reactions occurring in the skin (and sometimes other organ systems) that may result from taking a medication for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of a medical problem. They may appear after the correct use of the medication or drug. It may also appear due to overdose (the wrong dose is taken), following accumulation of drugs in the body over time, or by interactions with other medications being taken or used by the individual. Drug eruptions could be caused by an allergy or hypersensitivity to the drug, by a direct toxic effect of the drug or medication on the skin, or by other mechanisms. Drug eruptions vary in severity – from a minor nuisance to a more severe problem – and may even cause death. Drug eruptions occur in 8% of the general population and 15% of hospitalised patients. 1 ",
        "Who gets drug eruptions and reactions?": "The potential to develop an adverse reaction to a drug is influenced by the age, gender and genetic makeup of the individual; the nature of the condition being treated; and the possible interactions with other medications being taken. Some classes of drugs are known to cause drug eruptions more commonly than others. Commonly implicated medications include anti-epileptics, antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins), antiretrovirals, allopurinol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and proton pump inhibitors. Some drug eruptions occur after many weeks to months of taking the medication. In some individuals, a reaction may occur to a medication that they had no issues taking before. ",
        "What causes drug eruptions and reactions?": "Drug eruptions can be caused by medications that have either been prescribed, purchased over-the-counter or purchased as compounded herbal/naturopathic medicines. Drugs taken orally, injected, delivered by patch application and rubbed onto the skin (e.g. creams, ointments and lotions) can all cause reactions. ",
        "What do drug eruptions and reactions look like?": "The appearance of drug eruptions varies depending on the mechanism of the drug reaction. In cases of allergy or hypersensitivity, the rash may be exanthematous (widespread small red spots resembling measles or just a widespread reddening of the skin), urticarial (hives), pustular (bumps filled with pus) or bullous (blistering) in appearance. The rash can be itchy, painful or cause an abnormal sensation on the skin. Some adverse drug eruptions may mimic other skin conditions such as acne (pimples), porphyria (a genetic disorder that is triggered by light), lichen planus (itchy purple bumps with possible mucosal, hair and nail involvement), vasculitis (inflamed blood vessels), lymphoma (cancer of blood cells) or lupus (an autoimmune condition worsened by the sun). Sometimes the drug may exacerbate a pre-existing skin condition (e.g., acne, psoriasis, eczema). Not all skin drug eruptions look the same. The same drug may cause a different reaction in different individuals. ",
        "How are drug eruptions and reactions diagnosed?": "Taking a detailed drug/medication history is essential in diagnosing a drug eruption. Information on drugs that have been taken long-term is as important as the drugs that have been commenced recently or used intermittently. All prescribed medications including all topical medications, over-the-counter drugs, recreational drugs, natural remedies such as herbal medicine, vitamins and supplements need to be reported to the doctor. A careful clinical examination of the skin is necessary. Other tests that may be needed include: ",
        "How are drug eruptions and reactions treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and the severity. If a drug reaction is suspected, the suspected drug or drugs should be discontinued. In an uncomplicated case, once the offending drug is withdrawn the condition is expected to improve. Depending on the severity of the condition, emollients under wet dressings, topical or oral steroids, oral antihistamines, other medications or immunosuppressants, or hospitalisation may be required. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of drug eruptions and reactions?": "Many drug eruptions will tend to resolve within 7 to 14 days, but some can persist for longer. The likely outcome will depend on the severity of the reaction and whether internal organs are involved. Individuals with a serious drug eruption should seek urgent care immediately. Individuals who have developed a drug eruption will require ongoing follow-up and education. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Pompholyx": "Also known as … Dyshidrotic Eczema or Vesicular Eczema of Palms and Soles What is Pompholyx? Pompholyx is an often recurrent and frequently extremely itchy disorder characterised by tiny blisters and bumps on the sides of fingers, toes, palms and soles. The cause of pompholyx is unknown. Pompholyx is considered a localised reaction pattern seen in other forms of dermatitis such as atopic dermatitis and allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. Pompholyx is characterised by the sudden onset of crops of symmetric, firm, deep-seated tiny blisters on the palms, sides of fingers and less often on the soles and toes. These may aggregate and form larger blisters. Intense itch and/or burning sensation usually precede the eruption. The attack can subside spontaneously over weeks to months. It is often recurrent. In long-standing cases, the individual’s fingernails may discolour or develop ridges.Occasionally a bacterial infection, cellulitis or lymphangitis may develop. Diagnosis of the pompholyx reaction pattern is based on a clinical examination of the hands and feet. A detailed history and wider clinical examination of the skin is needed in order to rule out an associated condition and guide further investigations. The following associated conditions should be considered:• Atopic eczema        o May be a late stage reaction and there may not be many other signs of dermatitis. History of past dermatitis is relevant.• Contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis – nickel, cobalt, chromium and cosmetics have all been associated with a pompholyx reaction. Patch testing may be required.• Irritant contact dermatitis has also been associated with pompholyx.• Infections       o Inflammatory fungal infections may be associated with an id or pompholyx like reaction.       o Examination and investigations for evidence of bacterial or fungal infection may be required.• Stress can be associated with a worsening of the pompholyx.• Pompholyx has been associated with some immune system modifying agents.• Hyperhidrosis of hands and feet may be associated with an increased likelihood of contact dermatitis and fungal infections that may trigger the pompholyx reaction. Pompholyx may be difficult to treat. It is important to treat an associated condition, if present. General advice:• Avoid contact with irritants or allergens• Use bland unscented moisturisers or just plain water, to clean hands• Wear protective gloves in everyday activities• Stop smoking• Apply bland moisturisers frequently Topical therapy:The cornerstone of topical therapy is high-strength cortisone creams that may be appliedwith wet wraps or cling wrap to increase their effectiveness. Other anti-inflammatorycreams such as calcineurin inhibitors can also be effective. Management of bullae or blisters:Blisters can be managed with compresses soaked in a very light pink solution of potassium permanganate or Burrow’s solution (10% aluminium acetate solution diluted to 1:40). Large blisters can be aspirated (pierced with a sterile needle). Oral medications:A short course of oral anti-inflammatory medication such as prednisolone may be required in severe flare-ups of pompholyx. For severe, recalcitrant and chronic cases, corticosteroids may be combined with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin. Antihistamines can be helpful in treating the associated itch in some people. Phototherapy and photochemotherapyVariable effects have been reported using topical PUVA, oral PUVA or narrowband UVB to help control the inflammation.

        "What is dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa?": "Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is one of the main types of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). This group of inherited skin fragility disorders is characterised by blistering of the skin and body linings with minimal injury. There are four main types of EB which are defined by the depth at which the skin becomes blistered. There are two main layers of the skin, the epidermis (the very top layer) and the dermis. These two layers are joined at the basement membrane zone. In DEB the skin fragility and blistering occurs below the basement membrane zone (deeper down in the skin compared with the other types of EB). Approximately 20-25% of individuals with EB have DEB. 1 ",
        "What gets dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa?": "DEB affects males and females equally and can affect individuals from all races and ethnicities. The more severe forms of DEB are usually diagnosed early in life as infants with the condition can be born with raw areas of skin and blistering and wounding of the skin and mouth can occur from the first day of life. Some of the milder forms of DEB may not be diagnosed until later in life when the child starts walking and develops blisters at sites of friction from footwear or clothing. ",
        "What causes dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa?": "DEB is a genetic disease. It is caused by a variants (like a spelling mistake) in the COL7A1 gene that makes type VII collagen, one of the main proteins that hold the skin together. Variants in the COL7A1 gene causes the type VII collagen protein to be weak or even absent, resulting in skin fragility and blistering with minor injury. DEB may be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern. Dominant DEB (DDEB) is usually inherited from one parent who already has DEB and is generally regarded as a milder form of DEB. Recessive DEB (RDEB) occurs when both parents are carriers for the condition but do not have symptoms themselves. DEB can also occur spontaneously where there is no family history of DEB and neither of the parents are carriers for the condition. ",
        "What does dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa look like?": "The different subtypes of DEB can vary greatly in severity. Skin blistering usually appears at birth or the first few weeks of life. In DEB, the blisters and skin wounds tend to heal with scarring and milia (small white lumps). Scarring can lead to significant deformity with joint contractures and fusion of the fingers and toes. The nails often grow abnormally or may be absent. Eyes, ears, mouth, teeth, throat, gullet, genitals and urinary tract may also be affected. Damage and scarring to these structures may lead to difficulty with vision, hearing, eating, swallowing, speaking and toileting. Complications arising from severe RDEB can also include anaemia, kidney disease, osteoporosis and squamous cell carcinoma (a form of skin cancer).  Figure 1. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Habif’s Clinical Dermatology. A Color Guide to Diagnosis and Therapy. SEVENTH EDITION James G.H. Dinulos, MD ",
        "How is dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa diagnosed?": "Correct diagnosis of the EB type is important as each type has different levels of severity and outcomes: ",
        "How is dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. There is currently no cure for DEB. The aim of treatment is to reduce the development of new blisters, promote skin healing and prevent infection. Local treatments for the skin may include: Protecting the skin Blister management Wound care DEB blisters and wounds are painful and regular pain relief is usually required. DEB is often a multisystem disorder and a collaborative approach to management across several different medical and allied health specialities is usually required. The multidisciplinary team may include dermatologists, specialist nurses, paediatricians, plastic surgeons, dentists, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, dieticians, endocrinologists, pain specialists, psychologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, podiatrists, speech therapists and social workers. There have also been some recent advancements in treatment for DEB. A new gene therapy was approved by the FDA for use in the USA in 2023.3 However, this treatment is not currently available in Australia. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa?": "As DEB is a genetic condition, the skin fragility and blistering tendency will persist lifelong. Scarring to the skin and body linings is progressive and therefore the severity of DEB may increase over time with progressive disability. Individuals with more severe forms of DEB (usually RDEB) may have an increased risk of developing an aggressive form of skin cancer at a relatively young age.4 Long-term monitoring with a multidisciplinary care approach is recommended for individuals with severe forms of DEB.

        "Orf": "Also known as … Scabby Mouth, Sheep Pox or Ecthyma contagiosum What is orf? Orf is an infection caused by the parapox virus which primarily infects sheep and goats. The condition is most commonly seen in animal handlers, butchers and farm workers. Anyone can become infected by touching the affected animals or by contact with infected pastures. Orf occurs worldwide. Orf is spread through direct contact with lesions of infected animals or through fomites found in animal enclosures (touching contaminated surfaces or particles). Typically, infected animals have warty sores and scabs on their muzzle and, less commonly, on their lower legs and teats. However, some infected animals may not have any visible sores at all. Orf lesions are usually seen on the fingers or hands of an individual who has touched the infected animal (e.g. bottle feeding or shearing the animal). Occasionally the orf lesions can also be seen on the face or other parts of the body that may have been in contact with the infected animal. The orf lesion evolves through distinctive stages and can be painful.  A red bump develops about 1 week after contact with the virus. An infected person may experience mild fever and malaise for the first few days.  Red streaks (infected lymph channels) may be visible on the affected limb and the nearby lymph glands can be enlarged. The red bump may grow from 2 to 5 cm and develop rings of white and red around a central red area, after which it usually becomes a blood/pus/fluid filled blister which can weep and bleed easily.  A dry crust usually develops on top and the lesion then starts to take on a warty appearance.  The lesion will heal without treatment after 4 to 6 weeks, usually without scarring. The infection does not usually spread from person to person. There is no specific treatment as orf usually heals on its own. Appropriate dressing care and pain relief may be given if necessary. Antibiotics may be given if there is a secondary bacterial infection. Those at risk should wear protective non-porous gloves when handling sheep and goats and practise good hand hygiene.

        "Enteroviral Vesicular Stomatitis": "Also known as … Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease. Enteroviral vesicular stomatitis or hand foot and mouth disease is a common contagious viral illness that spreads from person to person. It usually occurs in children but can affect individuals of any age. It is a usually a short illness (7 to 10 days) that results in fever, tiredness and tiny oval shaped blisters on the hands, feet and painful erosions in the mouth but resolves without treatment. In rare cases, the disease can be more serious. A group of viruses is responsible for causing hand foot and mouth disease. The most common cause is coxsackievirus A16 but it can also be due to other viruses in this genus including enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus A5, A7, A9-10, B2, B5 and echovirus. People suffering from hand foot and mouth disease generally feel unwell and have a fever and sore throat. They can also have red or grey spots or tiny blisters (vesicles) on the hands, feet, mouth and pharynx (which connects the mouth to the oesophagus). Babies may have a rash in the nappy area in addition to the other symptoms. Hand foot and mouth disease is highly contagious and spreads by contact with oral or nasal secretions (for example droplets from coughing or sneezing or saliva) or from the fluid in the blister of someone suffering from the disease. Another way the disease spreads is through the faeces of a person with hand foot and mouth disease. Blisters are infective until they have dried up. Faeces remain infective for up to a month after the illness. Generally, hand foot and mouth disease is a self-limiting condition, which means that it resolves on its own with no other problems. In rare cases, it can be more serious especially in immunocompromised people (those whose immune system is not functioning normally) or pregnant women. Some of the rare complications include: In most cases, the diagnosis is made from the medical history and clinical examination. Occasionally, laboratory tests may be required to confirm the diagnosis including swabs or blood tests (serology). Sometimes, your doctor may order a combination of both tests. There is no specific treatment for hand foot and mouth disease. Management aims to control symptoms such as fever or pain from ulcers in the mouth. Mouthwashes or sprays applied directly to ulcers can provide pain relief. It is important to keep hydrated by having small regular sips of water and getting adequate rest. The blisters should be left to resolve naturally. Many cases of benign follicular mucinosis burn out and resolve over a few months to years, particularly if the skin lesions are few in number and localised. Other cases can be more persistent, particularly if the skin lesions are more widespread. There can be permanent bald patches if scarring has occurred. If there is an underlying lymphoma, the prognosis is less favourable. This information has been written by Dr Anousha Yazdabadi Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Who gets epidermal naevus?": "Epidermal naevi most commonly occur in the first year of life. However, they can present at birth or develop throughout childhood. ",
        "What causes epidermal naevus?": "Epidermal naevi occur when early in the life of the embryo a genetic mutation develops in one cell, which divides and populates the cells along a line of development (Blaschko’s lines). This mutation is not found in other cells of the body. To date mutations have been found in HRAS, KRAS, PIKC3A, FGFR (fibroblast growth factor 2 and 3), KRT1 and KRT10 (keratin) when the skin is sampled. However, skin biopsy is not the usual way for making the diagnosis. ",
        "What does epidermal naevus look like?": "Epidermal naevi can have a dark, rough or warty texture (verrucous EN) or a yellow bumpy appearance (naevus sebaceous) or may look like a swirl or line of blackheads (naevus comidonicus) or can even be red and scaly (inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal naevus ILVEN). Becker’s naevus usually appears on the trunk of an older child with a raised, brown and hairy patch. Figure 1. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Habif’s Clinical Dermatology.

        "What causes epidermodysplasia verruciformis?": "EV is an inherited disorder. In most cases, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means an individual must have both copies of mutated EV genes to be affected. Most individuals can carry a copy of the mutated gene but not show signs nor symptoms. However, there has been some cases of atypical inheritance reported. ‘Acquired epidermodysplasia verruciformis’ or EV-like eruptions can result from having an impaired immune system i.e. HIV infection, organ transplantation or cancer. ",
        "What does epidermodysplasia verruciformis look like?": "The disease usually manifests in childhood with multiple pink or tan flat bumps (papules), flat pinkish white or brown spots that resemble pityriasis versicolor or thicker warty lesions that resemble seborrheic keratosis. Lesions are most numerous on the face, neck and backs of the hands and feet. ",
        "How is epidermodysplasia verruciformis diagnosed?": "It is diagnosed based on clinical and skin biopsy findings. HPV subtype can be detected within the cells using specialised techniques (PCR). ",
        "How is epidermodysplasia verruciformis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. EV is a lifelong disease. Treatment options are available for individual lesions. These may include: Prevention of skin cancers is important. This can be achieved by using appropriate sun protection measures and performing regular self-examinations of whole body, including scalp, hands and feet to ensure familiarity with skin. ",

An epidermoid cyst is a benign walled-off cavity filled with keratin which originates from the hair follicle unit.  Epidermoid cysts are the most common type of cyst. They may be primary or they may arise from disrupted follicular structures due to trauma or comedone formation (blackheads). Multiple cysts may occur in the conjunction with acne vulgaris, Gardner syndrome and in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Tiny superficial epidermoid cysts are known as milia. Epidermoid cysts appear as flesh coloured to yellowish, firm, round nodules of variable size. A central pore or punctum may be present. They are usually symptomless but sometimes discharge a foul smelling, “cheese-like” material. Less frequently, the cysts can be painful due to inflammation or infection. The diagnosis is usually made by a clinical examination. Sometimes a biopsy may be needed.

        "Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita": "Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita (EBA) is a rare blistering disease which produces deep, tense blisters on the skin and mucosal surfaces (mouth, genitals, nose and eyes) which typically heal with scarring. EBA can occur at any age but more frequently affects elderly persons. EBA is an autoimmune disease. It arises when the white blood cells of the immune system produce antibodies which attack the collagen proteins (known as anchoring fibrils) which “sew” the outer skin (epidermis) onto the inner skin (dermis). The destruction of these fibrils leads to the development of a blister due to the separation of the two layers of the skin. The exact trigger for this immune attack is unknown. EBA can present with a number of different clinical signs. Mostly it evolves slowly with noticeable skin fragility and small or large blisters that affect the trauma-prone extensor skin surfaces (hands, feet, elbows, knees and buttocks). In a subset of affected people, it may be more generalised and progress more rapidly with widespread itchy red tense blisters. In this group of affected people, blisters occur in both trauma-prone and non–trauma-prone areas. This can be mistaken for other more common blistering diseases such as bullous pemphigoid or linear IgA disease. EBA can also affect the nails, mouth, eyes, genitals, larynx and oesophagus. Sometimes these are the main areas involved. The blistering characteristically heals with scars which can lead to difficulty with vision, eating, swallowing and speaking. Although the exact relationship is uncertain EBA has been associated with Crohn’s disease and Lupus Erythematosus. These are also autoimmune diseases. EBA often requires coordinated care from a number of specialists depending on the areas of involvement. These may include dermatologists, ophthalmologists, ear nose and throat specialists, and dentists. As this is an autoimmune disease, medications that target and suppress this abnormal immune response are necessary. The aim of treatment is to control and stop the development of new blisters, promote healing and prevent scarring. EBA response to treatment is not always predictable and treatment tends to be necessary for months to years depending on disease activity. Treatments are tailored to each individual. Local treatments for the skin include: Oral medications are often required. These can include: EBA tends to run a chronic course and long-term follow-up is often necessary.  The disease activity may fluctuate at times. The aim of treatment is to manage the disease to prevent long-term problems from scarring.

        "Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex": "Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS) is one of the main types of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This group of inherited skin fragility disorders is characterised by blistering of the skin with minimal injury. There are four main types of EB which are defined by the depth at which the skin becomes blistered. There are two main layers of the skin, the epidermis (the very top layer) and the dermis, which are joined at the basement membrane zone. In EBS, the skin fragility and blistering occurs above the basement membrane zone within the lowest part of the epidermis. As the level of blistering in EBS is higher up in the skin compared to other forms of EB, it is often regarded as a more mild type of EB. Approximately 70% of people with EB have EBS, making this the most common type of EB. EBS is a genetic disease. It is caused by a mutation (like a spelling mistake) in one of genes that makes the proteins that hold the skin together. Mutations in these genes cause the proteins to be weak or even absent resulting in skin fragility and blistering with minor injury. EBS is almost exclusively inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. A parent with EBS has a 50% chance of passing EBS onto their child with each pregnancy. EBS can sometimes occur spontaneously where there is no family history. In these cases, EBS is due to a new genetic mutation, which occurs around the time of conception. Skin blistering may appear at birth or the first few weeks of life, but it may also manifest later in childhood. In the mildest and most common form of EBS, blistering is usually confined to hands and feet and may not appear until the child starts walking. Blistering is usually causing by rubbing of the skin, especially by footwear. This is usually worse in warm weather. As this subtype of EBS is mild, affected individuals do not usually require a lot of medical assistance. In the more severe forms of EBS, blistering can occur all over the body and may be complicated by significant skin inflammation and infection. Blisters can also occur inside the mouth in EBS. Skin blistering usually heals without leaving scars and the hair and nails are usually not significantly affected. Proper diagnosis of the EB type is important as each type has different severity and outcomes: There is currently no cure for EBS. The aim of treatment is to reduce the development of new blisters, promote skin healing and prevent infection.  Treatments are tailored to each individual. Local treatments for the skin include: Other treatments include: As EBS is a genetic condition, the skin fragility and blistering tendency will persist lifelong. This fragility and blistering can be worse in the earlier years of life and there may be some improvement in adulthood. EBS wounds usually heal without leaving permanent scars and patients have a normal life expectancy. There is currently no known cure for EBS, although research is actively being conducted worldwide to find better treatments for people living with this condition.

        "Who gets erythema ab igne?": "EAI commonly affects individuals that are exposed to occupational fires, individuals who use heat packs, individuals chronically exposed to electronics and those with medical conditions associated with decreased sensation. ",
        "What causes erythema ab igne?": "Chronic exposure to heat below the threshold for a thermal burn (i.e. below 45°C) is the primary cause of EAI. The exact way EAI develops is unclear, but the pattern associated with the condition corresponds with the blood vessels of the skin. ",
        "What does erythema ab igne look like?": "In the early stages, there may be a temporary redness in a pattern resembling a lacework or fishing net. This fades easily when pressed. After chronic exposure to heat, the redness network becomes fixed and does not fade. Later-stage lesions may show atrophy (thinning of the skin), become scaly and blisters may appear. There are usually no other symptoms associated with EAI, but some individuals may experience a burning sensation or itchiness. The location, size and shape of the lesions are often associated with a particular heat source. For example: Figure 1. Erythema ab igne on shin – Images reproduced with permission of A/Prof Deshan Sebaratnam. Figure 2. Erythema ab igne on lower back – Images reproduced with permission of A/Prof Deshan Sebaratnam Figure 3. Erythema ab igne on lower back – Images reproduced with permission of A/Prof Deshan Sebaratnam ",
        "How is erythema ab igne diagnosed?": "EAI is usually diagnosed clinically based on clinical features and medical history. A biopsy is not performed to confirm diagnosis unless there is suspicion for malignant change. ",
        "How is erythema ab igne treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Management primarily consists of avoiding the source of chronic heat exposure. For persistent discolouration that is distressing to the individual, topical agents (e.g., retinoids such as tretinoin) or laser therapy may be considered. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of erythema ab igne?": "With reduced exposure to the heat source, mildly affected areas may resolve in several months.

        "Erythema Annulare Centrifugum": "Also known as … Superficial or Deep Gyrate Erythema, Erythema Perstans, Palpable Migrating Erythema What is Erythema Annulare Centrifugum? Erythema Annulare Centrifugum (EAC) refers to an annular (ring-shaped) erythematous (red) skin eruption that tends to spread outwards whilst clearing centrally. The cause of EAC is unknown but it is probably due to a hypersensitivity reaction to a variety of agents including drugs, insect or spider bites, infections (bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal), food ingestion (such as blue cheese), malignancies or some underlying diseases. In most cases no cause will be found for the EAC. Some people with EAC may have no symptoms whilst others experience mild itching associated with the rash. EAC usually begins as a small raised pink-red spot that slowly enlarges forming a ring shape while the central area flattens and clears. There may be an inner rim of scale. Sometimes the lesions do not form complete rings but grow into irregular shapes. As lesions resolve, there is no residual scarring but the skin may temporarily become redder. One or several lesions of EAC may be localised to one area of the body or generalised over many areas. Lesions most often appear on the thighs and legs. They may occur anywhere on the body but typically spare the palms and soles. The diagnosis of EAC is made by clinical examination. Further investigations may be needed to exclude other causes of annular rashes and to look for an underlying cause. In some cases a skin scraping is needed to exclude fungal infections that may mimic EAC. A biopsy of the skin may be needed in some cases. EAC is usually self-limited which means that it usually resolves without treatment. However, eruptions may last from a few weeks to many years. EAC has been known to resolve once the underlying diseases has been treated. The prognosis for EAC is excellent except in rare cases when it is associated with an underlying cancer or disease.

        "Erythema Dyschromicum Perstans and Lichen Planus Pigmentosus": "The terms Erythema Dyschromicum Perstans (EDP), Lichen Planus Pigmentosus (LPP) and Idiopathic Eruptive Macular Pigmentation (IEMP) are names given to pigmentary disorders and often used interchangeably. Even pigmentary disorder experts around the world differ in their opinion about the features of these conditions! Erythema Dyschromicum Perstans (EDP) Also known as…Ashy Dermatosis EDP was first described by Ramirez in El Salvador in the 1950s. The condition is seen most commonly in women and in those with more deeply pigmented skin including Latin Americans and Asians. EDP usually affects people between the ages of 20 to 30. It tends to involve areas of the body that do not get exposed to the sun. EDP is chronic and is challenging to treat. While hydroquinone and tretinoin are helpful in some pigmentary conditions such as melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, they do not work very well for EDP. Dapsone and clofazamine have been described as being helpful for some people. While many other treatments have been evaluated including topical steroids and chloroquine, none have resulted in significant lightening.  More research is needed to increase treatment options. Lichen Planus Pigmentosus (LPP) LPP is a rare variant of lichen planus usually seen in middle-aged individuals with more deeply pigmented skin (e.g. South Asians, South-East Asians and the Arabic population). LPP may present with itchy, scaly brown-grey spots without red borders. The condition most commonly affects sun-exposed sites such as the head (forehead and temples) and neck but spots are often seen in skin folds such as the armpits (LPP inversus) and in some cases the mucosal surfaces (e.g. the mouth). Unlike EDP, LPP does not have any lesions with red borders. Although the exact cause of LPP is unknown,  ultraviolet light has been implicated due to the location of the spots. Mustard and amla oils have been reported as possible causes in some studies. Sunscreen and sun-protection are very important in the treatment of LPP. Various small studies reveal tacrolimus cream, corticosteroid creams and tablets and vitamin A creams may be helpful in treating LPP. Further research is needed to increase treatment options.

        "Erythema Infectiosum": "Also known as…Parvovirus B19 Infection, Fifth Disease or “Slapped Cheek” Disease What is Erythema Infectiosum? Erythema Infectiosum is usually a harmless childhood viral infection characterised by a classic slapped-cheek appearance or a lacy patterned rash. The infection can be associated with fevers. Human parvovirus B19 is a member of the family Parvoviridae. The time from contact to clinical signs and symptoms varies between 4 and 14 days. Transmission is via respiratory secretions, blood products and from a pregnant woman to her foetus. Approximately 75% of cases occur in children aged 5 to15 years but any age group can be affected. Worldwide epidemics of the infection tend to occur in late winter or early spring. One infection gives lifelong immunity. The infection is so common that more than 50% of all adults have been infected by the age of 20. Up to half of those who contract the condition have no signs or symptoms. Mild symptoms such as low-grade fever, muscle aches and headache may occur 7 to10 days before the characteristic rash appears. Rose-red spots on the cheeks rapidly come together to form a hot, red, sunburn-like or “slapped-cheek” appearance. Usually, the rash does not affect the areas around the nose, eyes and mouth. A red bumpy rash may occur 1 to 4 days later on the extremities and to a lesser extent on the trunk. This progresses to a lacy, reticulated pattern. Sometimes spots may appear in the mouth. The rash typically lasts between 1 and 3 weeks. It may recur with exercise, irritation, stress or the skin overheating from sun exposure or bathing in hot water. In adults, especially women, polyarthralgia (multiple inflamed joints) is often the main symptom of infection. Small joints of the hands as well as wrists, knees and ankles are most commonly affected. Joint pain may be present without an accompanying rash. Acute cases are associated with a distinctive syndrome called “papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome”. This is characterised by swelling and redness of palms and soles in association with pinpoint purple spots. Erythema Infectiosum can cause a much more serious infection and trigger a range of complications in high-risk groups: Other conditions associated with or triggered by the condition include: The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical appearance of the rash alone. Blood tests may be needed in cases of doubt or when a pregnant woman has been exposed to the infection. The classic childhood form of the condition is self-limiting which means that it resolves spontaneously without complications. There is no specific treatment. Affected children may remain at school as the infectious stage occurs before the rash is evident. Often the only intervention needed is to reassure parents of affected children. It is important that everyone in the same household washes their hands frequently to reduce the chances of the infection spreading. Symptoms can be relieved by: Pregnant women who may have come into contact with people in the incubation stage or in aplastic crisis should be referred for obstetric follow-up care for possible serologic testing and close foetal monitoring. Individuals predisposed to aplastic crisis require hospitalisation and are likely to need transfusion and/or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. There is no vaccination to prevent the infection.

        "Erythema Multiforme": "Erythema Multiforme (EM) is an acute skin condition that may be recurrent in some cases. It occurs most commonly in association with the herpes simplex virus as an immune response to the infection. Young males are most commonly affected. There are two types of EM – EM minor and EM major.  EM minor is a milder form of the condition with no mucosal involvement. EM major is a more severe, potentially life-threatening condition with one or more mucosal sites involved (e.g. inside eyes, mouth, genitalia). EM minor tends to be limited to the extremities, whilst EM major tends to start on the face and trunk and is more widespread. Most cases are triggered by the herpes simplex virus, in the form of a cold sore or, less commonly, genital herpes. Other cases are associated with a chest infection such as mycoplasma pneumonia. EM major is more frequently due to a reaction to medications such as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-epileptics. Mild symptoms including feeling unwell, low-grade fevers, sore joints or coughing may precede the classic rash.  Early on, itching and burning in the skin may be present. In some cases there may be no preceding symptoms. EM starts abruptly over two to three days as dull, red spots, which later become raised or blistered. The condition progresses into classic target-like lesions consisting of concentric rings.  Typically there is a dusky/purple pink centre, surrounded by a zone of pale pink and an outer red ring. Commonly, these occur on the palms, soles and extremities. The lesions often come up as clusters in a symmetrical distribution. EM major typically involves mucosal surfaces with painful blistering, ulceration and crusting.  Affected individuals are often quite unwell with high fevers and may have enlarged lymph glands. The diagnosis is usually based on the classic target-like appearance and distribution of the rash. A biopsy may be taken to confirm the diagnosis. A swab or blood test may be required to look for an underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. If a drug is suspected it must be ceased.  Topical steroids may be prescribed to help with itching.  If mucosal membranes are affected, hospitalisation may be required for more severe cases. An eye specialist may be involved if the eyes are affected. Those with recurrent EM are often associated with herpes simplex virus, and prophylactic anti-viral medications can be helpful in such cases. EM minor is not serious and usually heals without any complications in 3 to 4 weeks. EM major can rarely result in permanent scarring on mucosal sites, such as the eyes.

        "Erythema Nodosum": "Erythema nodosum is the most common type of panniculitis (inflammation of the fat layer in the skin) leading to red, raised nodules usually over the shins, ankles and knees. Erythema nodosum can occur at any age but most commonly occurs between 20 to 40 years of age. It occurs more commonly in women than men. Erythema nodosum is considered to be a hypersensitivity response to different provoking agents. This leads to activation of the immune system and inflammation of the fat layer in the skin. The condition can be triggered by a wide variety of stimuli such as previous streptococcal throat infection, pregnancy, tuberculosis, medications, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease), sarcoidosis and rarely malignancy. Less common causes include infection such as Yersinia enterocolitica and Mycoplasma. Various drugs (such as the oral contraceptive pill, salicylates, sulphonamide drugs, iodine/bromide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may also precipitate the condition. However, more than fifty per cent of cases have no identifiable cause. Erythema nodosum is characterised by the sudden development of red, painful nodules over the shins and/or lower legs. At first, the lesions are a bright red colour and are raised above the skin. After 1 to 2 weeks, they flatten and become a darker red/purple colour. The nodules usually do not form pus and do not ulcerate. They usually heal without scarring. Leg ache and ankle swelling are common in the initial phase.  In rare cases, other sites such as upper thighs, upper arms and face can be involved. Other symptoms can include fever, lethargy, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and joint pain. Usually the diagnosis of erythema nodosum can be made by your doctor from a clinical examination and medical history. Sometimes a biopsy of the fat layer may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. The classic finding in the biopsy is a septal panniculitis (inflammation of the septae dividing the fat into lobules). A number of tests may also be needed to determine the underlying cause. These include blood tests for markers of inflammation, antistreptolysin titre (to test for previous streptococcal throat infection), calcium levels, ACE level (to test for sarcoidosis) and quantiferon gold (test for active tuberculosis). Your doctor may also order a urine test, chest X-ray, throat swab (to test for group A streptococci) and stool culture (to test for Yersinia enterocolitica). If no underlying cause is found, treatment usually involves elevating the legs and wearing compression stockings. Nodules usually disappear in 2 to 4 weeks. Aspirin and other anti-inflammatory medications can be helpful for pain. Potassium iodide and prednisone have also been used successfully in treating erythema nodosum. If an underlying cause has been found, treatment of the condition or removal of the offending medication will usually lead to resolution of symptoms. In most people, the lesions resolve within 4 to 6 weeks. However, leg pain and swelling of the ankles may persist for weeks after this. Children usually have a shorter illness than adults. Relapses tend to occur more commonly in those with erythema nodosum of unknown cause and erythema nodosum not associated with respiratory tract infections. Complications from the condition are highly uncommon. This information has been written by Dr Rashi Minocha and Dr Anil Kurien Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "What is it?": "Erythrasma is a very common skin condition that affects the groin, under the arms and in between the toes. ",
        "What causes it?": "Erythrasma is an infection of the skin caused by an overgrowth of a bacterium called Corynebacterium minutissimum. It can affect healthy adults, but it more frequently affects older people with obesity, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), diabetes mellitus or people who live in tropical climates. Infection is facilitated under conditions of moisture and occlusion. ",
        "What does it look like?": "Erythrasma appears as well-defined scaly red, pink or brown patches. The most commonly affected areas are the groin, armpits, between the toes and in other skin folds. It can sometimes become generalized and affect larger areas on the body. The patches can sometimes be itchy or have an odor. [nivoslider slug=”erythasma”] ",
        "How is it diagnosed?": "Erythrasma is diagnosed based on the history and physical appearance of the lesions. A special lamp called a Wood’s lamp can be used to help confirm the diagnosis, as erythrasma glows bright pink under the lamp. ",
        "How is it treated?": "Erythrasma can be treated with either topical (applied directly to the skin) or oral therapies. For patients with localised disease, a topical antibiotic such as clindamycin or erythromycin can be used. On the hand, it can be difficult to treat extensive areas with creams and so oral antibiotics (clindamycin or erythromycin) may be preferred.   It is important to note that recurrence is common. ",

        "What is erythromelalgia?": "Erythromelalgia is a rare skin condition mainly seen in people aged over 60. The patient experiences episodes of burning redness and heat most commonly in the feet, but in can occur in the hands Erythromelalgia occurs in less than 2 persons per year. It is a little more common in women. ",
        "What causes erythromelalgia?": "The cause of erythromelalgia is not completely understood. Recent research has shown changes in the small nerves controlling sweating and changes in the control of blood flow through the skin vessels in some sufferers. It may also be seen in association with blood disorders such as leukaemia, lymphoma, polycythemia vera or conditions in which the there is an increase in the number of platelets, or connective tissue disorders and other conditions that may result in damage to the nerve supply to the blood vessels ",
        "The diagnosis of erythromelalgia is usually made cinically": "The patient gives a history of episodes redness, burning and warmth of the skin of feet (involved in 90% of patients) and in 25% of cases the hands will also be involved.The patient experiences heat and burning pain in the feet or hands that is relieved to some extent by cooling the affected areas. Attacks occur most commonly at night and often interfere with sleep. Patients often describe sleeping with their feet stuck out from under the blankets as warming often makes symptoms worse There are other other conditions of nerves and blood vessels that may show some some of the same symptoms and changes in appearance of the skin. Further investigations or evaluation by other specialists may be needed ",
        "How is erythromelalgia treated?": "Treatment is often difficult – there is no single simple solution for the chronic fluctuating pain experienced Some degree of trial and error is often needed. A good supportive relationship with family doctorand specialist is helpful. Avoid hanging the legs down, don’t use heavy warm blankets at night. Alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate so may aggravate the symptoms. Heat and exercise often make symptoms worse.  Using ice packs should be avoided on the affected area as it aggravates the symptoms Capsaicin cream applied regularly may reduce the pain in the skin as does Amitryptiline cream. or lLdocaine patches. Gabapentin or Amitryptiyline in small doses taken regularly may be helpful in controlling the chronic pain and discomfort.Sometimes assistance must be sought from Pain Management experts.

        "Hirsutism": "Also known as … Excessive hair growth The term hirsutism refers to excessive hair production in both males and females. However, medically it is used to define increased hair growth in women. Hirsutism affects 5-10% of women. Most cases of hirsutism are of unknown or genetic origin. It may also occur because of an underlying condition. Hirsutism can be an emotionally significant problem.  However, effective treatments are readily available. The underlying mechanism in hirsutism is an increased sensitivity of the hair follicle to male hormones known as androgens. An enzyme known as 5-alpha-reductase may also be a major contributing factor. As a result, terminal hairs (coarse, pigmented hairs which grow under the influence of androgenic hormones) grow more quickly and become darker and thicker. There may be a family history of hirsutism. The cause may be genetic or the result of an underlying condition. Hirsutism of unknown or genetic origin usually begins at puberty. Hirsutism due to an underlying condition usually has a later onset. Hirsutism refers to the growth of coarse terminal hairs and not the soft fine lightly pigmented vellus hairs. The most commonly affected areas include terminal hairs on the upper lip, outer cheeks, chin and jawline, chest, legs and thighs, forearms, upper and lower back areas and abdominal areas. Hirsutism has been associated with the following conditions and/or drugs: The doctor will determine the need for further testing based upon the person’s medical history and a physical examination. Blood tests and imaging may be needed to exclude an underlying condition. This may include testing for the following: If PCOSis suspected, tests may include: Referral to an endocrinologist may be necessary. There are both medical and physical treatments for hirsutism. Medical treatments for hirsutism include: Several OCPs on the market contain anti-androgens including cyproterone acetate and drospirenone. This medication acts by blocking androgen receptors and can be combined with the OCP. Side effects include menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and mood swings. Spironolactone may elevate potassium levels and regular monitoring with blood tests is advisable. This medication can be effective in the treatment of hirsutism, either as a stand-alone treatment or combined with the OCP or spironolactone. This medicationblocks dihydrotesteron and is also used to treat male pattern baldness. Finasteride should not be taken during pregnancy due to the risk of genital malformations in male foetuses. This medication can be effective in cases of PCOS. Monitoring of blood sugars is mandatory. This topical treatment is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for use in Australia. Eflornithine works by inhibiting the production of an enzyme necessary for hair growth in the hair follicle. This slows the rate of hair growth. Treatment will need to continue for life. Physical methods of treatment include: This is the most effective method of hair removal or permanent hair reduction. The wavelength of laser-light method will depend on the skin type. People with darker skin type can be safely treated with long pulse 1064 nm Nd Yag lasers. People with lighter skin can be treated with 755 Alexandrite lasers or intense pulse light (IPL). To achieve an 80-90% reduction in hair growth, multiple treatments are needed. Laser and light treatments can only treat dark hair and not white or pale hairs. In people with an underlying hormonal condition such as PCOS, top up sessions are usually required yearly to prevent recurrence. This depends on the cause. If an underlying cause is identified and treated, hirsutism may resolve. Some cases which are genetic in nature will improve after menopause. However, the majority will persist life-long. Laser hair reduction is the most promising treatment for dark hairs. If conducted correctly, hair reduction can be permanent. In cases where a hormonal imbalance is present, “top up” treatments once to twice a year may be needed. Choosing the correct laser wavelength is paramount for safety and efficacy, especially in darker skin types. Consulting an experienced laser practitioner is important.

        "What is extramammary paget disease?": "Extramammary paget disease (EMPD) is a rare type of skin cancer, characterised by a chronic scaly rash of the anogenital areas. EMPD favours elderly women older than age 50 years. ",
        "What causes extramammary paget disease?": "EMPD has two forms, primary and secondary. Primary EMPD accounts for approximately 80% of EMPD. Primary EMPD is thought to originate from cancer cells of either the top layer of the skin (called epidermis), or a type of sweat gland (called apocrine gland) of the epidermis. Secondary EMPD accounts for approximately 20% of EMPD. Secondary EMPD arises from the spreading of underlying internal cancer. Common internal cancers associated with EMPD includes carcinomas of the colon, rectum, bladder, urethra, cervix and prostate. ",
        "What does extramammary paget disease look like?": "EMPD presents with a slowly expanding, moist, red, raised rash with a sharp border between normal and involved skin. There may be scattered areas of white scale and erosion, which is often described as “strawberries and cream” appearance. There may be associated itch, bleeding or burning sensation. The vulva in women and the perianal region in men are the most commonly affected areas. Other sites on which EMPD may occur on include the scrotum, penis, perineum and armpits. In patients with secondary EMPD, they may present with findings of an underlying cancer, such as a swollen lymph node. ",
        "What other problems can occur with extramammary paget disease?": "EMPD is associated with a significantly reduced quality of life. For patients with a secondary internal cancer, delay in diagnosis may lead to cancer progression and metastases. ",
        "How is the extramammary paget disease diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist after taking a skin biopsy. Further investigation may be required. In woman, a pelvis and breast examination (and possibly a mammogram) should be performed. In men, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate examination should be performed. Further imaging for metastases may also be considered. ",
        "How is extramammary paget disease treated?": "Wide local excision or Mohs micrographic surgery is recommended as the first-line treatment for extramammary paget disease. EMPD is often treated with a combination of treatment options, for example:• Topical imiquimod• Radiotherapy• Photodynamic therapy• CO2 laser• Topical 5-fluorouracilRecurrence is common, hence patients with EMPD should be followed up regularly after treatment. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of extramammary paget disease?": "The prognosis for primary EMPD is excellent if appropriately treated. Risk factors that can worsen prognosis include lymph node or vessel invasion, deeper tumour, and possibly, an elevated CEA level. The prognosis for secondary EMPD will depend on the type and aggressiveness of the underlying internal cancer. ReferenceCooper S.M. & Wojnarowska F. Anogenital (non-venereal) disease.

        "Fabry Disease": "Also known as … Angiokeratoma Corporis Diffusum, Alpha-galactosidase A Deficiency, Anderson-Fabry Disease. Fabry disease is a rare genetic condition, belonging to a group of diseases called lysosomal storage diseases. Fabry disease is an x-linked genetic condition. This means it can be passed on from the mother only. Men are more severely affected; women may have minor symptoms or no symptoms at all. The disease is caused by a genetic mutation or mistake in the encoding of an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A (AGA).  This results in reduced production of the enzyme which this in turn leads to accumulation of a fat molecule (globotriaosylceramide) in various tissues throughout the body. Multiple angiokeratomas are present on the skin in most affected individuals. These are small dark red or purple lesions scattered on the trunk and limbs, predominantly in a “bathing-suit” distribution. The inside of the mouth is sometimes affected. Angiokeratomas first appear at puberty and can increase in size and number with age. They are harmless and painless.  Men with Fabry disease may also have dry skin with decreased sweating and poor exercise tolerance. Fabry disease can affect many organs of the body and manifestations vary between individuals. The most commonly affected organs include the kidneys and heart. Other affected organs include the gastrointestinal tract, brain and peripheral nervous system and eyes. The skin manifestations can offer a clue to the diagnosis of Fabry disease. However, the diagnosis is generally made from a blood test which measures blood AGA enzyme levels. A urine sample may also be required. Skin biopsies show distinctive findings but are not usually required. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, multiple other tests may be required to determine the type and extent of internal organ involvement. Genetic testing can be performed on the affected person and other female relatives. Prenatal diagnosis is available for subsequent pregnancies. This tests the foetus to see if it has the same genetic mutation. Disease monitoring and treatment are performed at specialist centres. Treatment options depend on the type and severity of internal organ involvement. Enzyme replacement therapy is available for some affected individuals through the Life Saving Drugs Program. Angiokeratomas do not require treatment except for cosmetic purposes. They respond well to treatments with vascular laser or electrocautery. The prognosis depends on the severity of internal organ involvement.

        "Who gets adult acne?": "Adult acne is more frequently seen in women. It is usually less common in men. ",
        "What causes adult acne?": "Several factors may cause adult acne, including: It is unclear whether increased levels of male hormones (androgens) in the blood or small amounts of locally produced male hormones stimulate oil glands to produce more oil or sebum. Laboratory investigations are often normal in these patients. A dermatologist may look for evidence of increased hair growth, female patterned scalp hair loss and irregular menstruation. Other clinical features could be problems with infertility or signs of insulin resistance. Some medications may precipitate or aggravate acne. ",
        "What does adult acne look like?": "Adult acne usually looks like adolescent or teenage acne vulgaris. It often presents with whiteheads, blackheads, red bumps (papules), pimples and inflamed pus-filled spots (pustules, nodules, cysts), which can lead to scarring. Adult acne often occurs on the face around the lower cheeks, jawline and neck. In some cases, adult acne can develop on the back and chest. Increased oiliness may be noticed on the scalp. The post- inflammatory healing phase with redness or brown hyperpigmentation is also seen. The acne lesions are often tender and long lasting. Many women affected with adult acne experience a flare-up of their acne the week prior to their menstrual cycle. ",
        "How is adult acne diagnosed?": "Adult acne is diagnosed clinically by observing the presence of whiteheads, blackheads, red pumps, and pimples and inflamed pus-filled spots on the face, chest or back. In some cases, further blood or imaging investigations may be needed if there are suspected hormonal abnormalities or signs of insulin resistance. ",
        "How is adult acne treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Adult acne treatment is the same as for acne vulgaris, and may include: In adult acne cases that are resistant to treatment, long-term low dose oral isotretinoin may be prescribed by dermatologists. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of adult acne?": "Adult acne is often characterised by flare-ups and acne-free periods. This may continue for several years but can usually be suppressed with treatment. Adult acne can be persistent for many years into a person’s 30s and 40s. In severe acne, scarring can develop because of deeper, more severe inflammation or pus-filled spots. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "What is female pattern hair loss?": "Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is the term used to describe genetic hair thinning in females. ",
        "Who gets female pattern hair loss?": "FPHL can affect women of any age but it is more common after menopause. Around 40% of women show signs of FPHL by age 50. 1 ",
        "What causes female pattern hair loss?": "Most women with FPHL have a genetic predisposition to this condition that could be inherited from either or both parents. However, some women with FPHL do not have any paternal or maternal family history of baldness. At the scalp level, hair follicles are more sensitive to the effects of androgen hormones that are required to drive this condition. This does not imply any underlying hormonal abnormalities. In fact, the vast majority of women with FPHL have normal hormonal profiles. Routine hormonal testing is not required but may be recommended by your doctor if you have other signs of androgen excess such as acne, irregular periods, excessive body hair, etc. FPHL is not caused by changes to your diet, infections or hair styling practices. ",
        "What does female pattern hair loss look like?": "FPHL presents as generalised thinning of hair and widening of the scalp parting. Some affected women also experience thinning at the frontal hairline or temples. There may be an increase in hair shedding. These changes usually lead to a reduction of the hair volume that may be evident by a shrinking hair ponytail. Some women get episodic bursts of accelerated hair shedding for a few months in between longer stable periods of little activity. ",
        "How is female pattern hair loss diagnosed?": "FPHL is usually diagnosed clinically. In some cases, a biopsy may be required to rule out other hair loss conditions that can mimic FPHL. ",
        "How is female pattern hair loss treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The main aim of FPHL treatment is to slow or halt the progression of hair loss. The secondary aim is to try and stimulate some hair regrowth. However, this may not happen for all individuals. Treatment options may include: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of female pattern hair loss?": "On long-term or indefinite medical treatments, progression of FPHL can be slowed and hair regrowth is a realistic expectation of treatment for some women. Without treatment, diffuse hair thinning progresses and hairs become sparser with more scalp visibility over time. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Erythema Infectiosum": "Also known as…Parvovirus B19 Infection, Fifth Disease or “Slapped Cheek” Disease What is Erythema Infectiosum? Erythema Infectiosum is usually a harmless childhood viral infection characterised by a classic slapped-cheek appearance or a lacy patterned rash. The infection can be associated with fevers. Human parvovirus B19 is a member of the family Parvoviridae. The time from contact to clinical signs and symptoms varies between 4 and 14 days. Transmission is via respiratory secretions, blood products and from a pregnant woman to her foetus. Approximately 75% of cases occur in children aged 5 to15 years but any age group can be affected. Worldwide epidemics of the infection tend to occur in late winter or early spring. One infection gives lifelong immunity. The infection is so common that more than 50% of all adults have been infected by the age of 20. Up to half of those who contract the condition have no signs or symptoms. Mild symptoms such as low-grade fever, muscle aches and headache may occur 7 to10 days before the characteristic rash appears. Rose-red spots on the cheeks rapidly come together to form a hot, red, sunburn-like or “slapped-cheek” appearance. Usually, the rash does not affect the areas around the nose, eyes and mouth. A red bumpy rash may occur 1 to 4 days later on the extremities and to a lesser extent on the trunk. This progresses to a lacy, reticulated pattern. Sometimes spots may appear in the mouth. The rash typically lasts between 1 and 3 weeks. It may recur with exercise, irritation, stress or the skin overheating from sun exposure or bathing in hot water. In adults, especially women, polyarthralgia (multiple inflamed joints) is often the main symptom of infection. Small joints of the hands as well as wrists, knees and ankles are most commonly affected. Joint pain may be present without an accompanying rash. Acute cases are associated with a distinctive syndrome called “papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome”. This is characterised by swelling and redness of palms and soles in association with pinpoint purple spots. Erythema Infectiosum can cause a much more serious infection and trigger a range of complications in high-risk groups: Other conditions associated with or triggered by the condition include: The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical appearance of the rash alone. Blood tests may be needed in cases of doubt or when a pregnant woman has been exposed to the infection. The classic childhood form of the condition is self-limiting which means that it resolves spontaneously without complications. There is no specific treatment. Affected children may remain at school as the infectious stage occurs before the rash is evident. Often the only intervention needed is to reassure parents of affected children. It is important that everyone in the same household washes their hands frequently to reduce the chances of the infection spreading. Symptoms can be relieved by: Pregnant women who may have come into contact with people in the incubation stage or in aplastic crisis should be referred for obstetric follow-up care for possible serologic testing and close foetal monitoring. Individuals predisposed to aplastic crisis require hospitalisation and are likely to need transfusion and/or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. There is no vaccination to prevent the infection.

        "Flushing": "Flushing is a term used to describe transient and episodic reddening of the skin. It occurs most commonly on the face and neck but less conspicuous changes may occur over the entire body. Flushing is the visible sign of a generalised increase in the skin blood flow that occurs with relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. This may occur due to changes in the autonomic nervous system (nerve supply which controls our body’s internal organs), our body’s internal chemicals and hormones (e.g. histamine and serotonin) or external factors (e.g. alcohol, drugs, food and food additives). There are a number of causes to consider: Affected people often report a feeling of heat and burning of the skin during an attack. Repeated flushing may lead to permanent redness, broken capillaries and rosacea. Flushing is diagnosed by taking a detailed history and physical examination including identifying predisposing factors and associated symptoms. Further laboratory tests, radiologic studies or referral to an endocrinologist may be needed. It is important to differentiate true flushing from other disorders that lead to facial erythema or redness such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, photosensitivity (sun sensitive) disorders or systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment is typically tailored to the underlying condition or avoidance of trigger factors. This information has been written by Dr Davin Lim and Dr Heba Jibreal This page is currently under review.

        "Lichen Planopilaris": "Also known as … Follicular Lichen Planus Lichen Planopilaris (LPP) is a rare inflammatory scalp disorder characterised by scarring Alopecia (permanent hair loss) with several different patterns. The condition is considered to be a form of Lichen Planus which affects the hair follicles. Although the physiopathology is unclear, it is generally accepted that Lichen Planopilaris has an autoimmune cause (Lymphocyte-predominant Inflammatory Infiltrate) with follicular destruction and permanent hair loss. LPP is characterised by redness and inflammation of the hair follicles (Perifollicular Erythema), scaling (Follicular Hyperkeratosis) and permanent hair loss. Individuals may not have any symptoms or they may experience scalp itching and burning. There are three types of Lichen Planopilaris: The three types are distinguished mainly by the pattern of involvement. Patchy scalp involvement is a common presentation of classic LLP. Band-like alopecia involving the frontal scalp and eyebrows is typical of FFA. GLPLS is characterised by three distinctive features – scarring alopecia on the scalp, non-scarring Alopecia in the armpit and groin and widespread scaly or Keratotic Lichenoid Follicular Papules. The diagnosis of LPP is based upon the clinical examination and biopsy results. Proper selection of the biopsy site is crucial. Additionally, careful examination of the mouth, nails and skin may reveal evidence of lichen planus elsewhere. Managing the condition is often quite challenging as relapse after treatment is common. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and stop the disease progressing. Treatment is unlikely to induce hair regrowth in areas of existing hair loss (Alopecia). Localised treatment includes: Generalised treatment (systemic) options include: Hair transplantation may also be an option if the disease has been in clinical remission for at least 2 years. However, LLP recurrence following transplant has been described. Camouflaging hair loss with careful hair styling or the use of hair pieces, wigs, hair powder, hair color and eyebrow tattooing may also be considered. The likely outcome of LPP is unpredictable. The condition may stabilise or continue to slowly progress over time. Relapse following remission is possible.

        "What is follicular mucinosis?": "Follicular mucinosis is a rare disorder affecting hair-bearing skin, most commonly on the scalp, head and neck. The name of the condition comes from the accumulation of mucin (jelly-like, semi-liquid material) in the walls of hair follicles. Sometimes the mucin is visible to the naked eye, and the hair follicles are visibly prominent and seem to ooze a clear gelatinous material. Follicular mucinosis can either occur as a primary, benign condition (sometimes referred to as Pinkus follicular mucinosis), or in association with a lymphoma of the skin. Sometimes follicular mucinosis may show up in skin biopsy results for other inflammatory skin diseases. In these cases, it has no particular significance. ",
        "Who gets follicular mucinosis?": "Primary, benign cases of follicular mucinosis are more likely to occur in children, adolescents or young adults, while lymphoma-associated cases are more likely to occur in middle aged or older adults. ",
        "What causes follicular mucinosis?": "Primary, benign cases of follicular mucinosis are generally of unknown cause. In the lymphoma-associated form, the underlying condition is usually cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). The condition represents a direct involvement of the hair follicles by lymphoma cells (folliculotropic mycosis fungoides). Occasionally, other forms of lymphoma (e.g. Hodgkin disease) have also been associated with follicular mucinosis. ",
        "What does follicular mucinosis look like?": "The head and neck are the most commonly affected sites, especially the scalp and eyebrows. In some cases, the skin lesions can be more widespread. There are a number of different clinical appearances. Typically, there are pink papules (small bumps) or plaques (larger raised or thickened areas of skin) with prominent pores which are the hair follicle openings. The mucin (gelatinous clear material) may ooze from these pores, especially if the area is touched or squeezed. There is usually loss of hair in the affected areas, sometimes accompanied by scarring. The skin lesions may be itchy. There are no clear distinguishing features between benign or non-cancerous and lymphoma-associated cases. Benign cases are more likely to occur in younger individuals. There are a small number of skin lesions which are localised to the head and neck. Lymphoma-associated cases are more likely to occur in older individuals. A larger number of lesions occur across multiple body sites. ",
        "How is follicular mucinosis diagnosed?": "A skin biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Even with a skin biopsy, it can be difficult to distinguish between benign cases and lymphoma-associated cases. Once follicular mucinosis is diagnosed, further assessments are needed to exclude the possibility of an underlying lymphoma. This may include a physical examination, blood tests and imaging studies. Ongoing follow-up is also recommended. ",
        "How is follicular mucinosis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Benign follicular mucinosis may be treated using potent topical corticosteroids or intralesional corticosteroid injections. A range of oral medications may also be used including tetracyclines, retinoids and dapsone, antimalarials and corticosteroids.  In resistant cases, superficial x-ray therapy may be used. If an underlying lymphoma is diagnosed, treatment is directed towards the lymphoma. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of follicular mucinosis?": "Many cases of benign follicular mucinosis burn out and resolve over a few months to years, particularly if the skin lesions are few in number and localised. Other cases can be more persistent, particularly if the skin lesions are more widespread. There can be permanent bald patches if scarring has occurred. If there is an underlying lymphoma, the prognosis is less favourable. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Folliculitis": "Folliculitis means inflammation of the hair follicle. It is caused by infection, physical injury or chemical irritation. This results in a painful red spot, usually with an overlying pustule and central hair. The inflammation may be superficial or deep, and may affect all hair-bearing areas of the body. Folliculitis often occurs in moist or occluded (sweaty) areas.  It is due to infection – bacterial, viral or fungal – or irritation from environmental chemicals and certain skin conditions. Infectious causes Bacteria Yeasts Fungi Virus Parasites Environmental folliculitis Folliculitis due to skin diseases In a number of skin diseases the hair follicle is the main target of the disease process. Acne is a common skin problem in adolescence which may target the hair follicle. Other conditions include lichen planus, discoid lupus erythematosus, folliculitis decalvans and acne nuchae keloidalis. Follicular occlusion affects a group of conditions where the hair follicles become blocked and inflammation develops behind the blockage. The inflammation may be severe enough to lead to scarring. Other forms A dermatologist usually makes a diagnosis of folliculitis based on the person’s medical history and by examining the skin. To determine if the folliculitis is due to an infection, swabs are taken from the pustules for culture and sometimes a skin biopsy may be needed. General measures include: Other treatments will depend on the cause of the folliculitis. These may include: Many cases of benign follicular mucinosis burn out and resolve over a few months to years, particularly if the skin lesions are few in number and localised. Other cases can be more persistent, particularly if the skin lesions are more widespread. There can be permanent bald patches if scarring has occurred. If there is an underlying lymphoma, the prognosis is less favourable. This information has been written by Dr Shyamalar Gunatheesan Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Pseudofolliculitis Barbae": "Also known as…Razor Bumps, Shave Bumps, Barber’s Itch, Folliculitis Barbae Traumatica What is Pseudofolliculitis Barbae? Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is a chronic inflammation of hair-bearing areas of the skin caused by ingrown hairs that develop after shaving or plucking. This condition is more often seen in individuals with curly hair on the beard area and nape of the neck. Newly cut or shaved hair, especially when coarse and curly, tends to curl back and the sharp point penetrates the skin and causes a foreign-body reaction in the skin.  The hair shaft itself may have some structural weakness. This weakness in the hair may be inherited/passed down through families (i.e. genetic hair shaft weakness). This can contribute to the development of Pseudofolliculitis Barbae. Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is most commonly seen in the beard area of men of African background who have short, coarse and curly hair and who shave regularly. The condition may also be seen (though it is far less common) on other parts of the body that are shaved. Multiple red, skin coloured or brown lumps centred around the hair follicle are seen on the beard area (cheeks, chin and front of neck) and back (nape) of the neck. Sideburns and the moustache are normally not affected. As the condition progresses, larger lumps may develop and complications such as keloid scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may occur. Formal tests are not required to reach a diagnosis.  The dermatologist would need to distinguish this condition from a bacterial or fungal infection of the hair follicles. The best treatment is to allow the hair to grow out. Changing shaving practices will improve the condition: Chemical hair removers such as depilatory creams have been used but may cause irritation to the surrounding skin. If inflammation occurs, it can be successfully treated with certain steroid creams. A variety of alternative treatments are available such as steroid injections (intralesional steroids) and topical eflornithine hydrochloride. Laser hair removal and electrolysis may be used in cases that are not responsive to simple measures. Complications such as scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can be treated if necessary. Relapses occur frequently unless shaving practices are addressed and changed.

        "What is folliculitis decalvans?": "Folliculitis Decalvans is an uncommon inflammatory scalp condition which can result in the destruction of hair follicles and permanent hair loss. ",
        "Who gets folliculitis decalvans?": "The condition predominantly affects young and middle-aged adults and is more common in males. It can be hereditary in some families. ",
        "What causes folliculitis decalvans?": "The cause of folliculitis decalvans is not well understood. In many cases, bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can be isolated from the pustules. It is thought that S. aureus triggers an abnormal immune response which results in the inflammatory changes seen. ",
        "What does folliculitis decalvans look like?": "Affected areas develop recurrent crops of pustules. There may be redness, scaling, crusting and hair loss. This is a scarring alopecia (hair loss) which eventually results in pale, smooth, bald patches due to destruction of the hair organ. In some individuals, multiple hairs can be seen coming out of a single hair follicle. This is known as “tufting”. Folliculitis decalvans more commonly affects the top and back sections of the scalp. It is rare for other hair bearing areas such as the armpits, beard or pubic region to be affected. There may be itching, pain and tenderness in the involved areas.  However, some individuals do not experience any symptoms at all. ",
        "How is folliculitis decalvans diagnosed?": "The diagnosis can often be made from clinical history and examination findings alone. A swab may be taken from an intact pustule from the scalp to check for the presence of S. aureus. A skin scraping may be taken to exclude a fungal infection. Sometimes, one or two biopsies from the scalp may be needed to establish the diagnosis and exclude other hair loss conditions. ",
        "How is folliculitis decalvans treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. However, folliculitis decalvans can be difficult to treat with no single treatment having been shown to be consistently effective. Topical antibiotics such as 1% clindamycin may be helpful in mild cases. More severe disease will often require stronger medications, such as prolonged courses of oral antibiotics or isotretinoin (a Vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of cystic acne). Rifampicin is an antibiotic that is said to have stronger action against S. aureus and is often prescribed together with another antibiotic (clindamycin) to prevent emergence of bacteria resistance. Some affected individuals may require repeated courses of treatment to treat relapses. An antiseptic or tar shampoo may also be recommended to remove scale crust. Topical and intralesional (injections) corticosteroids can reduce inflammation, along with symptoms of itching and burning. Oral corticosteroids are occasionally prescribed to control aggressive disease. Other treatments reported to be useful include: Laser treatment (CO2, NdYag), light treatment (photodynamic therapy) or surgical procedures are less commonly used, and flare-ups have been reported following some procedures.

It may occur in combination with other conditions including hidradenitis suppurativa, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, pilonidal sinus and acne conglobata. The term AKN can be confusing because the condition is not acne and the scars formed are not true keloids. ",
        "Who gets acne keloidalis nuchae?": "AKN is mostly seen in men of African-Caribbean background, but it may also be seen in those of Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean backgrounds, and in rare cases, Caucasians. It is 20 times more common in males than in females1. ",
        "What causes acne keloidalis nuchae?": "The cause of AKN is poorly understood. Factors that may cause AKN include: ",
        "What does acne keloidalis nuchae look like?": "In the early stages of the condition, small firm bumps, pimples and crusts form around the hair follicles on the back of the scalp (occipital scalp). These papules can be painful and itchy. As the condition progresses, the bumps become small scars that extend from the back of the neck up to the top of the scalp and then enlarge to become keloid-like masses. In severe cases, irreversible scarring hair loss (alopecia) and/or abscesses with draining pus may occur. Tufted (“doll-like”) hairs may exist; these are multiple hair shafts from one hair follicle opening. Figure 1. Acne keloidalis Nuchae on the back of the neck. Image reproduced with permission of Dr Michelle Rodrigues ",
        "How is acne keloidalis nuchae diagnosed?": "AKN is diagnosed clinically through history and examination by finding bumps, pimples and scars on the scalp. In some cases, a skin sample (biopsy) of the scalp may be required to diagnose AKN and distinguish it from other forms of scarring hair loss that look similar. ",
        "How is acne keloidalis nuchae treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. AKN may often persist despite a variety of treatments. AKN treatment is aimed at preventing scarring and permanent hair loss, and may include: Surgical treatment or radiotherapy of the scarred area may be used for cases that are advanced or treatment resistant. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of acne keloidalis nuchae?": "While there is no cure, AKN can be treated if diagnosed early. It can be difficult to treat once scarring has developed.

        "Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis": "Also known as … Atopic Winter Feet, Forefoot Dermatitis, Moon-boot Foot Syndrome, Sweaty Sock Dermatitis What is Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis? Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis is a skin condition where there is cracking and peeling of the weight-bearing areas of the soles. The condition occurs primarily (but not exclusively) in children who have atopic dermatitis (eczema), asthma or hay fever. Their skin seems more sensitive than the skin of others and friction appears to play a role. Boys aged 3 to 14are most commonly affected. This condition tends to be better in winter when shoes and socks are being worn, deteriorating in summer due to increased friction with the foot moving more in sandals, particularly if sweaty. Wearing socks and shoes made of synthetic material can exacerbate the condition. The soles become shiny and glazed with some scaling, painful cracks and fissures. Sometimes the heel and palms are affected as well. The tops of the feet, the web spaces between the toes and the instep are typically spared. A diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on a medical history and the appearance of the rash. However, investigations such as skin scrapings or patch tests may be needed to distinguish it from other skin conditions (such as psoriasis, keratolysis exfoliativa, contact allergic dermatitis or fungal infection). Prognosis is good as the condition usually resolves by puberty.

        "Sweet’s Syndrome": "Also known as … Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis, Gomm-Button Disease What is it? Sweet’s syndrome is an uncommon condition named after the English dermatologist, Dr Robert Sweet, who first described it in 1964. Sweet’s syndrome usually presents with fever, a rise in white blood cells, raised red skin rashes and neutrophils (pus cells) infiltrating the upper layer of the skin. Fever and a rise in white blood cells are not always present. Sweet’s syndrome is sometimes initially mistaken for an infection or medication allergy. Sweet’s syndrome is a disorder of neutrophils (pus cells) and although it is not considered hereditary, there is some evidence of a genetic link. Most experts consider Sweet’s syndrome a “reactive condition” – it is driven by an underlying condition in up to 50% of cases. As the appearance of Sweet’s syndrome may occur before the underlying condition is recognised, ongoing monitoring is required, especially if the skin eruption is severe, recurrent or treatment-resistant or if blood abnormalities are detected. Sweet’s syndrome is a disorder of neutrophils (pus cells) and although it is not considered hereditary, there is some evidence of a genetic link. Most experts consider Sweet’s syndrome a “reactive condition” – it is driven by an underlying condition in up to 50% of cases. As the appearance of Sweet’s syndrome may occur before the underlying condition is recognised, ongoing monitoring is required, especially if the skin eruption is severe, recurrent or treatment-resistant or if blood abnormalities are detected. A skin biopsy performed by a dermatologist usually confirms the diagnosis. This shows neutrophils, some breaking down, entering the upper layer of the skin, particularly around the blood vessels.  The blood vessels may be damaged by chemicals released by the neutrophils. Blood tests are used to confirm a raised white cell and neutrophil count.  Blood tests also show inflammatory markers, such as ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) as being raised. Other tests such as urine tests, bone marrow testing, cancer screening and imaging studies (x-rays, CT scans) and tests to rule out infection are sometimes needed to look for associated conditions of Sweet’s syndrome. Sweet’s syndrome is treated by trying to identify and cure any underlying or associated disorder. In more than 50% of cases no cause or underlying medical association is found and the condition is treated with corticosteroid tablets (prednisone or prednisolone). Generally a rapid improvement is expected and the dosage of corticosteroids is gradually reduced over several weeks or months. Corticosteroids can be applied as a cream or injected into areas of Sweet’s syndrome in mild localised cases. Alternative treatments may be used in cases where corticosteroids are not effective or safe (e.g. the presence of a serious infection).  In small studies, a good response to indomethicin and colchicine or potassium iodide has been reported. People with Sweet’s syndrome have responded well to other drugs affecting neutrophil function including: “anti-infective” agents (eg dapsone, clofazimine, metronidazole or doxycycline); retinoids (eg isotretinoin); pentoxifylline and thalidomide; Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents (eg methotrexate, cyclosporine, chlorambucil) and biologic agents. The outcome of Sweet’s syndrome may be related to that of the underlying disorder if present, e.g. malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis etc.  With treatment, the fever and blood count usually improve within a couple of days and the rash clears within a few weeks. Some cases will clear without treatment over a number of weeks.  Recurrent episodes of Sweet’s syndrome affect about one-third of all Sweet’s syndrome cases and some will require long-term therapy. Most areas of Sweet’s syndrome fade without permanent marks but the appearance of pigmentation (brown marks) may take several months to fade.

        "Graft Versus Host Disease": "Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a condition which occurs after transplants, usually haematopoietic stem cell transplants but occasionally also solid organ transplants. As suggested by its name, it refers to when the “graft” (donor’s cells) attack the “host” (graft recipient’s cells). When the host attacks the graft is called “rejection of the graft”. GVHD can affect all the organs in the body, but the skin is the organ most frequently involved. There are three main forms of cutaneous GVHD, acute GVHD (aGVHD), lichenoid GVHD and sclerodermoid GVHD. The last two forms are considered in the setting of chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Acute GVHD aGVHD most commonly occurs 4-6 weeks after the transplant, and usually within 3 months of the transplant. It is thought to be caused by a rapid growth of donor immune cells such as T-cells, natural killer cells, and soluble factors, as a reaction to the host. These donor immune cells would attack three main organs of the body, the skin, the liver and the gastrointestinal tract. The severity of symptoms in aGVHD may vary from person to person, according to the amount of damage caused to these three organs. Chronic GVHD cGVHD usually begins 3 months or more after the transplant. It may progress from aGVHD but may also occur on its own in a minority of cases. The pathogenesis of cGVHD may have an autoimmune component, which is when the body produces autoantibody to fight against itself. Both T-cells and B-cells are shown to be involved in cGVHD. Acute GVHD aGVHD presents in the skin as a morbilliform exanthem (meaning a red rash resembling measles, with small lesions of 2-10mm joining to form bigger lesions). It most commonly affects the hands/feet, arms, ears, chest and upper back. The lesion may concentrate more around the hair follicles, but not always. Itch is variable between patients but can be very severe. Lesions may look bruised, if the patient has low platelet counts. aGVHD is staged clinically from 1-4 according to the body surface area involved, liver involvement measured by bilirubin levels, and gastrointestinal symptoms (Table 1). Skin conditions that may mimic aGVHD include drug reactions, engraftment syndrome and viral exanthems. Chronic GVHD Skin and mucosal involvement are common in cGVHD, and present in an early phase as lichenoid GVHD and a very late phase of sclerodermoid GVHD Lichenoid GVHD: Sclerodermatous GVHD Other manifestations: Acute GVHD Other than the skin, aGVHD can damage the liver and gastrointestinal tract to cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pains, deranged liver enzymes and elevated bilirubin. Table 1 outlines the clinical staging of aGVHD. Stage 4 disease confers a very poor prognosis. Table 1: Clinical staging of acute GVHD  Skin Liver Gastrointestinal tract Stage 1 <25% body surface area Bilirubin 2-3 mg/dl Diarrhoea 0.5-1L/day, or persistent nausea Stage 2 25-50% body surface area Bilirubin 3-6 mg/dl Diarrhoea 1-1.5L/day Stage 3 >50% body surface area Bilirubin 6-15 mg/dl Diarrhoea >1.5L/day Stage 4 Erythroderma with blisters Bilirubin >15 mg/dl Severe abdominal pains Chronic GVHD cGVHD may manifest in almost all body organs including: Muscles: muscle cramps and weakness The diagnosis is usually made clinically by a dermatologist or a haematologist. A skin biopsy is sometimes required to rule out other diagnosis. Blood tests and imaging may be required to further investigate the other organs involved in GVHD. After a transplant, GVHD may be partially prevented with the use of immunosuppressive medications, including cyclosporin, methotrexate, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. These medications are usually started by the patient’s haematologist. Patients should be warned regarding the symptoms of GVHD and inform their doctor when they develop any. Earlier treatment may improve the course of GVHD. Acute GVHD Mild skin-limited aGVHD may be treated with topical steroids. However, most patients will require stronger, systemic medications including one or more of: Chronic GVHD When a patient develops cGVHD, he/she is best managed by a multi-disciplinary team in a tertiary hospital. Specialists that may be involved includes haematologists, dermatologist, psychiatrist, ophthalmologists, oral medicine specialists, gastroenterologist, cardiologist, respiratory doctors and gynaecologists, depending on the patient’s symptoms. Allied health staff such as physiotherapists are also helpful. Ongoing follow-up should be arranged. Lichenoid GVHD usually responds to systemics steroids and rarely more potent treatment is needed. On the other hand, sclerodermoid GVHD is more challenging to treat. Treatment often depends on the specific symptoms experienced by the patient, and efficacy of the treatments vary significantly between patients. Some of the treatment options include: GVHD is a double-edged sword. Its presence is associated with a decreased risk of malignancy relapse, but on the other hand, it can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Factors leading to a poorer prognosis in GVHD include a history of progressive involvement from acute to chronic GVHD, low platelets, high bilirubin, older edge, gastrointestinal symptoms and lack of response to therapy. Sclerodermatous GVHD is often very persistent and challenging to treat, requiring multiple treatment options to be trialled. Cowen EW, Graft-versus-Host Disease.

        "Granuloma Annulare": "Granuloma Annulare is a harmless skin condition. Localised Granuloma Annulare more commonly occurs over bony prominences. Although it commonly resolves on its own within a few months to few years, most people seek treatment at an earlier stage for cosmetic reasons or because of skin irritation associated with the condition. Granuloma Annulare occurs in all ages but is more common in people under the age of 30. It is rare in infancy. Females are twice as likely to be affected as males. The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown but it is likely to be a reaction to different triggering events. It is believed to result from a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to collagen within the skin, which causes granulomatous inflammation (collection of inflammatory cells known as macrophages). There have been a number of reported triggering events. These include mild non-specific trauma (such as animal or insect bites, tattoos, waxing-induced pseudofolliculitis, herpes zoster or chickenpox scars), infections (such as HIV, Epstein-Barr Virus, hepatitis B & C), medications (gold, allopurinol, diclofenac, quinidine, intranasal calcitonin, amlodipine), sun exposure or PUVA light therapy, vaccinations and Mantoux testing for tuberculosis. Familial cases have also been reported. The most common form is localised granuloma annulare, characterised by groups of skin coloured or red bumps or raised area of skin, often arranged in a ring shape. It is usually localised to one body site but it can be more widespread in 15% of cases. It most commonly affects the hands and arms (60%), legs and feet (20%), both upper and lower limbs (7%), trunk (5%) and least frequently the trunk plus other areas (5%). There are other less common forms of granuloma annulare: Granuloma annulare does not usually have any other symptoms but some people experience pain or mild itch. Localised granuloma annulare is sometimes associated with autoimmune thyroiditis. Generalised granuloma annulare may rarely be associated with diabetes mellitus, malignancy or autoimmune diseases and HIV infection. Localised disease is usually diagnosed by a clinical examination alone. Generalised or subcutaneous disease is  more difficult to diagnose and may require a skin biopsy. In some cases, it may be important to rule out an underlying cause such as infection, metabolic disease or malignancy. Most cases do not require treatment as there is a high tendency for the lesions to resolve spontaneously. Some people request treatment for aesthetic reasons. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids and intralesional corticosteroids. For more extensive or severe forms of the condition, treatments may include oral medications (such as steroids, isotretinoin, and dapsone) and phototherapy (light treatment). Most cases resolve spontaneously and do not cause any complications. However, the condition may recur months or years later at the same site. Localised disease usually resolves in a few months to few years, whilst generalised disease can take years to clear. Most heal without scarring. However, perforating granuloma annulare  can result in scarring. This information has been written by Dr Rashi Minocha and Dr Anil Kurien This page is currently under review.

        "Granuloma Faciale": "Granuloma Faciale is a rare benign skin condition, characterised by single or multiple erythematous (red) papules, plaques or nodules. This condition is more common in males and, as the name suggests, most frequently affects facial areas. The exact cause of Granuloma Faciale is unknown. It is not inherited. The production of substances known as “interleukin” may attract inflammatory cells to the lesions. Sun exposure and UV radiation may play a role in the development of Granuloma Faciale – it occurs more commonly in sun-exposed areas and lesions darken with UV exposure. Granuloma Faciale rarely occurs in childhood. The peak incidence is in middle age. This rare condition has an insidious onset. It presents as solitary or multiple papules, plaques or nodules on the face. These vary in size from a few millimetres to coalescing plaques several centimetres in size and from red-brown to a purplish hue. Close examination of the lesions may reveal prominent hair follicle openings and overlying dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias). The condition does not usually produce any symptoms. However, some cases may be painful or itchy. In rare cases, the neck, upper back and chest, as well as areas of high UV exposure, are affected. Granuloma Faciale is not associated with an underlying medical condition. A biopsy is often needed to confirm the diagnosis as other conditions may mimic Granuloma Faciale. The biopsy will distinguish it from other underlying causes such as: Granuloma Faciale is a chronic condition and rarely improves without treatment. Treatment options include: Topical treatments Intralesional corticosteroids injections Corticosteroids may be injected into affected areas. However, thinning of the skin (atrophy) is a risk of this treatment. Oral medication Oral medications have shown variable success and often need to be taken over a prolonged period. Dapsone is the most promising but must only be taken under specialist supervision. Hydroxychloroquine and clofazimine may also be considered. Vascular laser Pulse dye laser (595 nm) targets the blood vessels of Granuloma Faciale. Scarring from laser treatment is very rare. However, several treatments are required for best results. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy has been reported for treatment-resistant cases of Granuloma Faciale. Surgery Surgery may be considered for isolated small nodules that are resistant to other forms of treatment. The likely outcome of Granuloma Faciale is extremely variable and difficult to predict. Flare-ups and recurrences are common. If the condition recurs, it is practical to treat the affected areas again. For ongoing management, referral to a specialist should be considered.

        "Granulomatous Cheilitis": "Also known as … Cheilitis Granulomatosa, Miescher’s Cheilitis Granulomatous Cheilitis is a rare condition characterised by persistent, diffuse, soft-to-firm swelling of one or both lips. The exact cause is unknown. However, factors including allergy to foods and medication, contact allergy, genetic predisposition and infection have been implicated. The first symptom of the condition is often an intermittent and usually painless swelling. As it progresses, the episodes become more frequent and may involve both lips. There may be painful cracks, fissures, reddish brown discoloration and scaling. In rare cases, granulomatous cheilitis has been reported with facial nerve palsy and fissured tongue resulting in a condition known as Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome. A lip biopsy of the affected tissue is needed in most cases.  However, a biopsy may not be conclusive in the earlier stages. It is important to rule out other associated diseases including Crohn disease, sarcoidosis, foreign body reaction, lymphoma, angioedema and infection. The aim of treatment is to improve the person’s appearance and comfort. Spontaneous remission is possible, although rare. Symptoms may be improved by avoiding potential allergens which can be identified through patch testing. It is also important to effectively treat any underlying conditions.

        "Enteroviral Vesicular Stomatitis": "Also known as … Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease. Enteroviral vesicular stomatitis or hand foot and mouth disease is a common contagious viral illness that spreads from person to person. It usually occurs in children but can affect individuals of any age. It is a usually a short illness (7 to 10 days) that results in fever, tiredness and tiny oval shaped blisters on the hands, feet and painful erosions in the mouth but resolves without treatment. In rare cases, the disease can be more serious. A group of viruses is responsible for causing hand foot and mouth disease. The most common cause is coxsackievirus A16 but it can also be due to other viruses in this genus including enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus A5, A7, A9-10, B2, B5 and echovirus. People suffering from hand foot and mouth disease generally feel unwell and have a fever and sore throat. They can also have red or grey spots or tiny blisters (vesicles) on the hands, feet, mouth and pharynx (which connects the mouth to the oesophagus). Babies may have a rash in the nappy area in addition to the other symptoms. Hand foot and mouth disease is highly contagious and spreads by contact with oral or nasal secretions (for example droplets from coughing or sneezing or saliva) or from the fluid in the blister of someone suffering from the disease. Another way the disease spreads is through the faeces of a person with hand foot and mouth disease. Blisters are infective until they have dried up. Faeces remain infective for up to a month after the illness. Generally, hand foot and mouth disease is a self-limiting condition, which means that it resolves on its own with no other problems. In rare cases, it can be more serious especially in immunocompromised people (those whose immune system is not functioning normally) or pregnant women. Some of the rare complications include: In most cases, the diagnosis is made from the medical history and clinical examination. Occasionally, laboratory tests may be required to confirm the diagnosis including swabs or blood tests (serology). Sometimes, your doctor may order a combination of both tests. There is no specific treatment for hand foot and mouth disease. Management aims to control symptoms such as fever or pain from ulcers in the mouth. Mouthwashes or sprays applied directly to ulcers can provide pain relief. It is important to keep hydrated by having small regular sips of water and getting adequate rest. The blisters should be left to resolve naturally. Many cases of benign follicular mucinosis burn out and resolve over a few months to years, particularly if the skin lesions are few in number and localised. Other cases can be more persistent, particularly if the skin lesions are more widespread. There can be permanent bald patches if scarring has occurred. If there is an underlying lymphoma, the prognosis is less favourable. This information has been written by Dr Anousha Yazdabadi Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Leprosy": "Also known as Hansen’s disease What is leprosy? Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by the organism Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin and the nerves. It may also affect mucous membranes (such as the nose) as well as eyes and testicles. Long standing leprosy may cause limb deformities as well. The manifestation the disease takes largely depends on the person’s immune response to the bacterium. Leprosy is one of the oldest diseases known to mankind. It was often referred to in the Bible and was recognised in the ancient civilizations of China, Egypt and India. Throughout history, infected people have often been ostracised by their communities. Consequently they often hid their condition and avoided seeking treatment to avoid discrimination. In fact, the major form of treatment before effective drugs became available was forcible isolation and incarceration. Leprosy is a worldwide condition.  The majority of cases occur in Asia, South America and Africa but leprosy also occurs in the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and Australia. What causes leprosy? It is an air-borne infection spread from person to person. Although large numbers of people are exposed to the bacteria in endemic areas, only a small number go on to develop the disease. Usually long-term close contact is necessary for this to occur. The disease has a very long incubation period from 1 year to 20 years or even longer. It is not highly infectious and genetic factors are thought to be the main risk factor. About 95% of the population may be naturally immune. What does leprosy look like? In a large majority of affected people the first sign of the disease is feeling a numbness which may precede any skin lesions by a number of years. Temperature is the first sensation lost, followed by light touch, pain and then deep pressure. The first skin lesion is usually of indeterminate type, which causes one or more de-pigmented (pale) spots before spontaneous resolution or evolving into the borderline, tuberculoid or lepromatous types of leprosy. Main forms of leprosy Tuberculoid leprosy Borderline leprosy Lepromatous leprosy How is leprosy diagnosed? Leprosy has very characteristic clinical features but the diagnosis must be confirmed because of the need for prolonged treatment. Tests include a skin biopsy, showing characteristic granulomata and involvement of the nerves.  Special staining of the tissue may show acid fast bacilli, the number visible depending on the type of leprosy. In lepromatous leprosy, numerous Mycobacterium leprae bacilli may be found on smears taken from skin slits madein the ear lobes. However, the smears may be negative in the tuberculoid or indeterminate forms of the disease. How is leprosy treated? Management of leprosy is aimed at treating the infection and minimising potential physical deformities. The choice of antibiotics depends on the type of leprosy being treated. The forms of leprosy with fewer bacilli (paucibacillary leprosy) often respond well to rifampicin and dapsone – for 6 months. The more severe lepromatous form of leprosy (multibacillary leprosy) requires the addition of clofazimine and treatment for 12 months or longer. If a certain drug cannot be given due to allergy or other side effects, ofloxacin or clarithromycin are considered as substitutes.  Leprosy is not usually treated with a single drug alone, due to the risk of development of drug resistance. Oral steroids and/or thalidomide are helpful in preventing nerve damage. Surgery may be necessary to reconstruct a collapsed nose, decompression of a nerve abscess, or in managing limb deformities. Patient education is paramount. Leprosy can be cured but it is essential to take the full course of medication. Affected people become non infections soon after commencement of treatment. As such, affected people should not be isolated. Physical, social and psychological rehabilitation is necessary for those whose disease has been neglected. Reactions to leprosy treatment These are known as lepra reactions and are due to changes in the immune system. There are two types of lepra reactions: It is important to understand that leprosy is not a rare disease with at least 200,000 cases worldwide annually, including Australia. With appropriate treatment, leprosy is eminently curable.

        "Miliaria": "Also known as heat rash, prickly heat or sweat rash What is miliaria? Miliaria is a group of skin conditions that arise from blockage of sweat ducts. There are three types of miliaria classified by the level of blockage of the sweat duct. These include miliaria crystalline, miliaria rubra and miliaria profunda. Who develops miliaria? Miliaria appears in about 15% of newborns. Babies are more commonly affected than children or adults as their sweat ducts are not yet fully developed. Adults may also be affected, particularly those who work in humid and hot conditions. What causes miliaria? Miliaria is caused by obstruction of sweat ducts, often from heat and excess sweating. Common situations in which blockage of the sweat ducts occurs include: No known diseases are associated with miliaria. What does miliaria look like? Miliaria commonly appears in areas of skin that have been blocked particularly around the neck and upper trunk in both children and adults. Other areas that can be affected include the groin, waistline, under the breasts, skin folds and armpits. Unlike acne, miliaria does not arise around hair follicles. Miliaria crystallina appears as small, superficial and clear blisters. These break easily from mild friction or bathing. Miliaria rubra appears as small, red flat or bumpy spots that are usually itchy. In chronic and recurrent cases, the lesions can turn into pus-filled spots. Miliaria profunda appears as deep red or white lumps that are prickly. These lesions are generally not itchy as they appear below the itch receptors. How is miliaria diagnosed? Miliaria is most often diagnosed based on the typical appearance of the lesions. The doctor may perform a simple diagnostic test where a fine needle is used to rupture the blister so that the clear fluid/sweat can be assessed. A biopsy of the skin may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish it from other conditions that look similar (e.g. erythema toxicum neonatorum, neonatal cephalic pustulosis, candidiasis, Grover’s disease). The doctor may also request a skin swab to rule out secondary infection. Individuals who develop heat stress syndrome may need to have blood tests. What other problems can occur with miliaria? Miliaria spots can become infected and form abscesses (pus-filled lumps). In addition, when a large surface area of the body is affected, affected individuals can develop a high temperature and suffer from heat stress syndrome. How is miliaria treated? Miliaria usually disappears after the body is cooled down. It is best prevented by avoiding overheating and over swaddling. More severe cases (e.g. miliaria profunda) can take several weeks to resolve as time is required for the plugs that block the opening of sweat ducts to be pushed outward by new sweat duct cells. General measures recommended to improve symptoms: Soothing lotions (e.g. calamine lotion) or topical steroids may help to relieve symptoms. Antiseptics and antibiotics may be recommended if a secondary infection is suspected. What is the likely outcome of miliaria? Miliaria usually disappears without any significant complications once the affected person is placed in a cool and ventilated environment. In rare cases where a person suffers from chronic and recurrent miliaria rubra or profunda, a large number of sweat glands may end up not functioning properly. This can lead to compensatory facial sweating. Individuals who develop secondary infection or heat stress syndrome need appropriate follow-up by the doctor.

        "Herpes Labialis": "Herpes labialis, also known as “cold sores”, is a common blistering viral infection of the lip or around the mouth.  Also known as fever blisters or herpes febrilis. Herpes labialis is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV can produce primary (initial infection) and recurrent eruptions of herpes labialis. After the initial infection, HSV will remain within the sensory nerves of the individual. Recurrent eruptions of herpes labialis can occur in 20-40% of these individuals when the HSV reactivates or “wakes up” from its resting state. Most of the primary herpes labialis infections are silent with nil or mild symptoms. However, occasionally, infections may present as mouth ulcers in children or upper respiratory tract infection-like symptoms in young adults. Pain on swallowing and drooling may occur when the infection becomes severe. When recurrent herpes labialis occurs, groups of sores or blisters on an erythematous base, with crusting may occur on the border of the lips. It may also affect the skin around the month, inside the nose, cheek or inside the mouth. Ulcers inside the mouth, rather than on the lip, are more frequent in patients with low immune system.  HSV, especially the primary infection, can infect other body sites. Other organs can may be infected include the genitals (see herpes genitalis), nervous system/brain, eyes and prostate. HSV can also cause other skin problems, including: Neonatal HSV is a rare condition affecting newborns. Risk of transmission is highest for women with a primary HSV infection but can also occur in women with recurrent genital herpes. If you suspect your newborn to have HSV, he/she needs urgent medical attention. The diagnosis can be made clinically by a medical professional. The diagnosis may be confirmed with a swab (HSV PCR) of fluids from the sore. Mild sores of herpes labialis usually do not require treatment; however if treatment should be necessary, it is most effective when started early. It is often difficult to realise this on the initial infection but easier in future episodes. As herpes labialis is a virus, antiviral medications can be used to treat them. Treating the sore would possibly help reduce the severity of infection and/or shorten the duration of discomfort. The antiviral medication (e.g. acyclovir, famciclovir, valaciclovir) may be used directly to the sores as a cream, taken by mouth (oral), or rarely, administered through the applied veins (intravenous). Oral/intravenous antiviral medications are recommended for patients with eczema, low immunity, a lot of pain, multiple cold sores, and prolonged outbreaks. Intravenous antiviral medications are generally reserved for very severe multi-organ infections. If you have lots of pain, additional pain killers and soothing skin treatments may also be prescribed. If your eyes are affected, it’s important to seek medical attention urgently. Selfcare Apply a cool wet compress or wash with salt-water and pat dry gently with a disposable paper towel followed by application of a greasy moisturiser like petroleum jelly Symptoms improve as the sore scabs over a period of 7-10 days. The virus continues to stay in a dormant state. Some people get a single episode of infection only, while others can get recurrent infections. Certain factors that may increase the likelihood of recurrence include: infections like flu, acute stress or being tired, sunlight, skin injury or procedures like lasers. There’s currently no licensed vaccine available for HSV. If you get cold sores often (i.e. over 6 times per year) or have a low immune system, long-term prophylactic antiviral medications may be prescribed. In Australia, prophylactic antiviral medication is only on the PBS for HIV-infected patients with AIDS or low immunity. Prevention of transmitting herpes labialis Herpes labialis can be spread to others when the sores are raw and not yet scabbed over. Tips to prevent transmitting herpes labialis when the sores are active include: Figure 1. Herpes labialis on the border of the lips.

        "What is hidradenitis suppurativa?": "Hidradenitis suppurativa is a long-term painful condition, which causes boil-like lumps. They may leak pus and cause scarring. It is commonly found under the arms, between the breasts, in the groin and genital area. ",
        "Who gets hidradenitis suppurativa?": "Hidradenitis suppurativa often begins in puberty. It is more common in women and individuals with skin of colour. ",
        "What causes hidradenitis suppurativa?": "The cause of hidradenitis suppurativa remains unclear. It is thought that there is an exaggerated inflammatory response to the presence of bacteria trapped in blocked hair follicles in the skin. Some individuals may have another family member with this condition. Hormones may be involved, and some women notice a flare before their period. Other factors such as obesity, smoking and stress can play a role. It is not contagious. ",
        "What does hidradenitis suppurativa look like?": "There may be blackheads (comedones) or red lumps that look like boils (abscesses and nodules). Sometimes the lumps may leak pus. Scarring may form, leading to tunnels under the skin that leak pus. Figure 1. Hidradenitis suppurativa on underarm – Images reproduced with permission Professor Alan Cooper ",
        "How is hidradenitis suppurativa diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made clinically after considering an individual’s medical history and symptoms, and examining the areas involved. There is no specific test for hidradenitis suppurativa. ",
        "How is hidradenitis suppurativa treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking or vaping, aiming for healthy body weight, avoiding tight clothing and reducing stress are recommended. A sudden flare-up may be managed by painkillers, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, a warm bath or applying a drawing agent to encourage the pus to drain. Steroid injections into the area or minor surgical procedures may be performed. Simple absorbent dressings can soak up any discharge. The main method of treating mild disease involves antibacterial washes and topical antibiotics. To prevent flare ups, long courses of antibiotics can be used. Anti-androgens can be helpful, particularly in women who have flareups before their period. Metformin, a diabetic medication may also be helpful for some individuals. Biological agents which reduce the abnormal inflammation such as adalimumab and secukinumab may be used. There are some newer agents being trialled. Often surgery is required and combined with medical treatment. A technique called deroofing is often successful. Other treatment options may include retinoids (vitamin A-like drugs), photodynamic therapy and laser treatment. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of hidradenitis suppurativa?": "Hidradenitis suppurativa is not curable but is usually improved with treatment. The painful and recurrent nature of this disease can be very distressing to the affected individuals and impacts greatly on their quality of life and mental health. Treatment and control of the inflammation is important to minimise the condition progressing and scarring. Hidradenitis suppurativa often improves as the individual gets older. Most individuals do not progress to the most severe form of the disease. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Hirsutism": "Also known as … Excessive hair growth The term hirsutism refers to excessive hair production in both males and females. However, medically it is used to define increased hair growth in women. Hirsutism affects 5-10% of women. Most cases of hirsutism are of unknown or genetic origin. It may also occur because of an underlying condition. Hirsutism can be an emotionally significant problem.  However, effective treatments are readily available. The underlying mechanism in hirsutism is an increased sensitivity of the hair follicle to male hormones known as androgens. An enzyme known as 5-alpha-reductase may also be a major contributing factor. As a result, terminal hairs (coarse, pigmented hairs which grow under the influence of androgenic hormones) grow more quickly and become darker and thicker. There may be a family history of hirsutism. The cause may be genetic or the result of an underlying condition. Hirsutism of unknown or genetic origin usually begins at puberty. Hirsutism due to an underlying condition usually has a later onset. Hirsutism refers to the growth of coarse terminal hairs and not the soft fine lightly pigmented vellus hairs. The most commonly affected areas include terminal hairs on the upper lip, outer cheeks, chin and jawline, chest, legs and thighs, forearms, upper and lower back areas and abdominal areas. Hirsutism has been associated with the following conditions and/or drugs: The doctor will determine the need for further testing based upon the person’s medical history and a physical examination. Blood tests and imaging may be needed to exclude an underlying condition. This may include testing for the following: If PCOSis suspected, tests may include: Referral to an endocrinologist may be necessary. There are both medical and physical treatments for hirsutism. Medical treatments for hirsutism include: Several OCPs on the market contain anti-androgens including cyproterone acetate and drospirenone. This medication acts by blocking androgen receptors and can be combined with the OCP. Side effects include menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and mood swings. Spironolactone may elevate potassium levels and regular monitoring with blood tests is advisable. This medication can be effective in the treatment of hirsutism, either as a stand-alone treatment or combined with the OCP or spironolactone. This medicationblocks dihydrotesteron and is also used to treat male pattern baldness. Finasteride should not be taken during pregnancy due to the risk of genital malformations in male foetuses. This medication can be effective in cases of PCOS. Monitoring of blood sugars is mandatory. This topical treatment is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for use in Australia. Eflornithine works by inhibiting the production of an enzyme necessary for hair growth in the hair follicle. This slows the rate of hair growth. Treatment will need to continue for life. Physical methods of treatment include: This is the most effective method of hair removal or permanent hair reduction. The wavelength of laser-light method will depend on the skin type. People with darker skin type can be safely treated with long pulse 1064 nm Nd Yag lasers. People with lighter skin can be treated with 755 Alexandrite lasers or intense pulse light (IPL). To achieve an 80-90% reduction in hair growth, multiple treatments are needed. Laser and light treatments can only treat dark hair and not white or pale hairs. In people with an underlying hormonal condition such as PCOS, top up sessions are usually required yearly to prevent recurrence. This depends on the cause. If an underlying cause is identified and treated, hirsutism may resolve. Some cases which are genetic in nature will improve after menopause. However, the majority will persist life-long. Laser hair reduction is the most promising treatment for dark hairs. If conducted correctly, hair reduction can be permanent. In cases where a hormonal imbalance is present, “top up” treatments once to twice a year may be needed. Choosing the correct laser wavelength is paramount for safety and efficacy, especially in darker skin types. Consulting an experienced laser practitioner is important.

        "Urticaria": "Also known as…Hives What is Urticaria? Urticaria, or hives (sometimes referred to as welts or wheals), is a common skin condition that produces an itchy rash. It tends to come and go and can last for a variable period of time. It is sometimes accompanied by angioedema, which is swelling deeper in the skin, typically affecting the lips and peri-orbital areas of the face, but which may also involve the upper airways. The condition can be acute (lasting less than 6 weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than 6 weeks). It may be caused by a trigger, but most cases of urticaria have no known cause. Urticaria occurs due to the release of chemical mediators including histamine from mast cells in the skin. These mediators activate sensory nerves and cause small blood vessels to leak. This process is usually triggered by various immune pathways such as circulating IgE antibodies. The cause of this immune triggering is unknown in the majority of cases, but are commonly associated with various types of infections. Other triggers include chronic immunologic diseases, stinging and biting insects, allergy to foods or medications. The use of intravenous dyes during some radiological tests can sometimes trigger urticaria as well. Physical urticaria is urticaria which develops with skin exposure to heat, cold, pressure, exercise, water, vibration or sunlight. These conditions probably result from heightened skin sensitivity, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Urticaria typically is a smooth, raised rash. The colour can range from normal skin colour to pink or red. The rash may occur anywhere on the body and often starts off as small round spots that quickly enlarge and spread. The rash can be intensely itchy, but usually only lasts minutes to hours and then disappears within 24 hours. A viral or bacterial illness can occur before urticaria develops. Some chronic medical conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, mastocytosis or rheumatoid arthritis may occur with chronic urticaria. If the rash becomes painful, starts to show bruise like staining of the skin or lasts longer than 36 – 48 hours, then another condition called urticarial vasculitis should be suspected. No specific tests are required for acute urticaria, as the condition is often expected to resolve spontaneously, and tests to try to find a specific cause are usually not helpful. Allergy testing may be required if a specific food or contact trigger is suspected. For chronic urticaria, tests involving blood, urine and stool specimens may be required to identify any infection or underlying chronic immune disorder that may be causing the condition. The specific triggers that have been identified (such as a food or medication) should be avoided. In most cases, acute urticaria is self-limited and resolves spontaneously within 6 weeks. During this period, treatment with oral antihistamines is indicated for relief of itch and swelling. Antihistamines are commonly available as over-the-counter medications. These are often needed at higher doses than described on the package. They are very safe and helpful, but need to be taken regularly. In cases where antihistamines fail to control symptoms, stronger medications may be needed. Chronic urticaria is also frequently treated with antihistamine medication. They can often be effective in stopping itch, helping the rash to resolve and preventing future outbreaks of urticaria. If antihistamines are inadequate, other treatments are available. These include other histamine blockers, leukotriene inhibitors, phototherapy, hydroxychloroquine and immune suppressing medications. For chronic spontaneous urticaria, an injectable prescription medication called Omalizumab may be indicated for use in patients unresponsive to antihistamines. Medication usually needs to be continued for many weeks and long term treatment may be required in some cases to keep the condition under control.

        "What causes Hori’s naevus?": "Genetics and hormones play a role in the development of Hori’s Naevus. In normal skin, melanin-producing pigment cells (melanocytes) are present only in the upper layer of skin (the epidermis) and hair follicles. However, when these cells are present in the underlying area of skin (the dermis) it causes a condition known as dermal melanocytosis. Dermal melanocytosis is a spectrum of conditions and includes Mongolian spots, naevus of Ota, Hori’s Naevus and naevus of Ito.

It often presents with whiteheads, blackheads, red bumps (papules), pimples and inflamed pus-filled spots (pustules, nodules, cysts), which can lead to scarring. Adult acne often occurs on the face around the lower cheeks, jawline and neck. In some cases, adult acne can develop on the back and chest. Increased oiliness may be noticed on the scalp. The post- inflammatory healing phase with redness or brown hyperpigmentation is also seen. The acne lesions are often tender and long lasting. Many women affected with adult acne experience a flare-up of their acne the week prior to their menstrual cycle. ",
        "How is adult acne diagnosed?": "Adult acne is diagnosed clinically by observing the presence of whiteheads, blackheads, red pumps, and pimples and inflamed pus-filled spots on the face, chest or back.

        "Warts": "Also known as…Human Papillomavirus, Verrucae Vulgaris or Papillomas What are they? Warts are abnormal growths of the skin and mucosa caused by an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). The HPV family is made up of more than 100 different types. The common types in the skin include HPV-1, HPV-2, HPV-4 and HPV-27. These cause skin warts that are common in childhood and tend to disappear with increasing age. About 90% of all genital warts are caused by low-risk types such as HPV-6 and HPV-11. However, there are high-risk types such as HPV-16 and HPV-18 that are known to cause cancers. The infection is transmitted by direct person-to-person skin contact from an HPV infected person, from one part of the body to another in the same person, or indirectly through contaminated surfaces such as public areas (e.g. swimming pool, gymnasium). It can take up to a year for the wart to appear for the first time. HPV infects the cells in the outer layer of the skin, causing them to grow and form a wart. Warts are common in school-aged children but may arise at any age. They are more numerous and persistent in people who are immunosuppressed. Many people who become infected with HPV quite rapidly develop immunity and so do not develop any warts or other symptoms. The appearance of warts will differ in certain body sites. Most warts on the skin will disappear of their own accord. In children, even without treatment, 50% of warts disappear within 6 months and 90% resolve within 2 years. Warts are more persistent in adults, but may resolve eventually.  Some warts, such as plantar warts, may persist and become large and painful. Periungual warts can distort nail growth. The high-risk types of HPV (e.g. HPV-16 and HPV-18) have the potential to cause cancers such as cervical cancer, penile cancer, oral or anal cancers, and some types of skin cancer. Cancer developing in common warts is rare. Individuals with reduced immunity (e.g. immunosuppressant medication, HIV-infection) may develop multiple warts that are difficult to treat. In rare cases, a child can acquire HPV from an infected mother during delivery. This may result in warts appearing inside the airway causing hoarseness of the voice. Warts are contagious. Warts are often diagnosed through a clinical examination. A doctor may use dermoscopy (skin surface microscopy) to distinguish warts from similar spots such as seborrhoeic keratoses (commonly known as “age warts”). In rare cases, a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Many people choose not to treat warts because treatment can be uncomfortable and troublesome. Treatments should not cause any scarring as most warts may disappear on their own. Once started, it is important to persist with the treatment until the wart is gone. Pregnant women or those planning pregnancy should avoid certain treatments and discuss this with the treating doctor before commencing treatment. Local therapy Systemic therapy There are many other therapies available but the clinical evidence for their effectiveness is lacking. HPV vaccinations are available to prevent anogenital warts.  Vaccination prevents initial infection with HPV types 16 and 18 which cause most of the HPV associated cancers. Vaccination may also protect against HPV types 6 and 11 which cause 90% of genital warts. Individuals on a treatment plan must be followed up on a regular basis to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and potential adverse reactions such as redness, swelling or blistering. Many treatments will need to be repeated or different treatments may need to be combined in order to eradicate the wart.

        "Lentigo Maligna": "Also known as… Hutchinson’s Melanotic Freckle What is Lentigo Maligna? Lentigo maligna is an early form of melanoma. In lentigo maligna the cancer cells are confined to the upper layer of the skin (epidermis). When the cancer cells spread deeper into the skin (to dermis) it is called lentigo maligna melanoma. Lentigo maligna occurs most commonly in sun damaged areas such as the face and neck in fair skinned people over the age of 60. The lesion grows slowly in size over a number of years. Melanoma is a potentially lethal disease and lentigo maligna should be diagnosed and excised as soon as possible. The cause of lentigo maligna is sun exposure or solarium use. Factors that predispose a person to developing lentigo maligna or associated condition include: Lentigo maligna commonly looks like a freckle, age spot, sun spot or brown patch that slowly changes shape and grows in size.  The spot may be large in size, irregularly shaped with a smooth surface, and of multiple shades of brown and sometimes other colours. Thickening of part of the lesion, increasing number of colours, ulceration or bleeding can be markers that the lesion is changing into a lentigo maligna melanoma. Lentigo maligna is diagnosed clinically by a dermatologist, sometimes with the help of a dermatoscope (a tool used to magnify and look closely at skin moles). The lesion may be difficult to distinguish from a benign, non-cancerous lesion.  If the lesion is suspect, the doctor will biopsy or remove it to confirm the diagnosis. There are a few ways of treating lentigo maligna including: Lentigo maligna is usually removed by surgical excision with an appropriate margin around the lesion for the best outcome. More specialised surgery or other investigations may be needed in some cases. In cases where surgical excision cannot be performed (lesion is too large, surgery will be too deforming or contraindicated), other treatment methods include radiotherapy, cryotherapy and imiquimod cream.  Then close monitoring of the lesion is required. Lentigo maligna has a good prognosis when detected early and treated appropriately.  However, a small percentage of lesions may be undetected and progress to become an invasive melanoma which is potentially life-threatening. Regular follow-up and full skin examinations are need with the treating doctor to review past treatment sites and monitor areas of suspicion.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a rare liver condition which causes an itchy skin. There is no rash but the skin may show scratch marks (excoriations) or become yellow (jaundiced). This condition typically develops late in pregnancy and resolves within days after the baby is born. Closer monitoring of the pregnancy is recommended as this condition can have serious effects on the unborn baby.  The cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is unknown. The liver becomes less able to clear certain substances. Bile acids and bilirubin accumulate in the blood and cause an itchy skin. This condition sometimes runs in families. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically occurs in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Symptoms often begin on the palms of hands and soles of feet after which a widespread itchy skin develops. The skin may appear normal or show scratch marks and turn yellow as the condition progresses. Some women experience fatigue, nausea or abdominal discomfort. This condition is potentially serious for the unborn baby with an increased risk of foetal distress, preterm labour and stillbirth. In severe cases the mother may be less able to absorb vitamin K causing her to be prone to bleeding around the time of delivery. A diagnosis is made on a special blood test that shows an elevation in bile acid levels.  Liver function tests may be abnormal. A coagulation profile is often included in blood investigations to assess the risk of bleeding. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is usually treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, an oral medication that lowers bile acid levels, relieves itch and improves foetal outcome. Treatment should be started promptly and continued until the baby is born. Careful obstetric and paediatric care is important and babies may be delivered early. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy improves within a few days of delivery.  However it usually recurs in subsequent pregnancies and may also recur with commencement of the oral contraceptive pill.

        "Impetigo": "Also known as…School Sores What is Impetigo? Impetigo is an infection of the skin that can be passed from person to person. It can affect skin that is intact (known as primary impetigo) or skin that is already compromised with cuts, abrasions, insect bites or other skin conditions such as eczema (known as secondary impetigo or impetiginisation). Generally, the condition affects younger children but any age group can be affected. Impetigo is caused by bacteria, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus (also known as ‘Staph’) and less commonly Group A Streptococcus (GAS). These germs can pass from person to person by skin to skin contact or by using the same towels or bedding. Some factors such as hot humid weather, crowded living conditions, poor personal hygiene, an unhygienic work environment or a low or poorly functioning immune system can encourage the germs to infect the skin and cause impetigo. Impetigo can spread rapidly through families and school classes but it can also appear as an isolated case. In most people (about 70%), the rash starts with a red area which develops into small blisters filled with clear fluid or pus. The blisters join together and eventually break down leaving thick oozing crusts which have a characteristic golden yellow, honey colour known as “non-bullous impetigo”. This process usually takes about a week. Much less commonly, particularly in young children, the small blisters join together to form large, loose, floppy blisters known as “bullae” known as “bullous impetigo”. If the infection is deeper in the skin, an ulcer may form with a purplish colour around the outside and yellowish crust on top known as “ecthyma”. Most cases of impetigo clear without any ongoing problems if the infection is treated early.  As the patches clear up, the crusts tend to fall off and the areas usually heal without leaving scars. Temporary redness occurs in some cases. Serious problems occur very rarely. The bacteria can affect the deeper tissues of the skin causing “cellulitis”, the kidneys causing “post-streptococcal glomerunonephritis” or affect the heart. Most of these rare problems are caused by the germ Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The diagnosis is usually made by a doctor.  Treatment is started immediately based on the typical appearance of the rash. A swab of the affected skin may be taken to determine which bacteria is the cause and before treating with antibiotics.  A nose swab may also be taken to check for an underlying Staph infection. This condition is treated with antibiotics. Topical antibiotics are used if a small area of skin is affected. The crusts can be cleaned first with salty water (1 teaspoon of table salt is dissolved in a cup of hot water and left to cool) two to three times a day. Then a topical antibiotic such as topical mupiricin or fusidic acid is applied. Topicals antibiotics need to be used cautiously due to concerns of emerging resistance. Oral antibiotics are often needed if large areas of skin are involved or there are multiple patches.  Dicloxicillin or flucloxacillin are most commonly recommended. Other options include erythromycin, cephalexin or others depending on sensitivity of the particular offending bacteria. A full course (usually at least 7 days) should be completed. Oral antibiotics are also needed if the rash has large blisters (bullous impetigo) or is “ecthyma”. If Staph is grown from the nose swab, the nose will also need twice daily treatment with topical antibiotics (usually mupiricin) for 10 days. Children should be kept home from school or day care until all the crusted and/or blistered areas have cleared. If there is any other underlying skin condition, this should also be treated. Good personal hygiene is important. Nails should be kept short and clean and affected people should wash their hands frequently with antibacterial soap and water or waterless antibacterial cleansers. If the rash persists or you have any concerns, please see your dermatologist.

        "Infantile Haemangiomas": "Also known as…Strawberry Birthmarks What are Infantile Haemangiomas? Infantile haemangiomas are the most common benign growths of infancy and childhood, affecting 2.6¬ to 4% of babies by 6 weeks of age. The cause of infantile haemangiomas is not well understood, but the placenta is considered to play a role. Certain risk factors including being female (incidence of females to males is 2:1), prematurity (being born early), low birth weight, vaginal bleeding early in the pregnancy and an amniocentesis (a test carried out in early pregnancy) are thought to play a role. Infantile haemangiomas may look like a patch of white skin with a few visible blood vessels on the surface. In many cases it is not noticed at birth. Within 1 to 3 weeks of birth the blood vessels start to multiply and divide and the haemangioma develops into a bright red strawberry colour. If the blood vessels extend deeper into the skin, there will be the appearance of a bluish swelling underneath the skin. In some cases the haemangioma may present as a bluish swelling only, without the accompanying strawberry coloured overlay. The haemangioma grows rapidly in the first 8 to12 weeks after which it slows and stops growing at 4 to 9 months of age. A dulling of the colour indicates the beginning of the regression phase. The time it takes to improve depends on the size of the haemangioma however most have regressed by 4 to 5 years of age. Despite significant improvement in all cases, the skin may not return to normal, particularly if the haemangioma had been very raised. The skin may be left stretched and wrinkled with some soft fatty tissue and a few surface blood vessels. Infantile haemangiomas which affect large areas of the face can be associated with a range of abnormalities of the brain, heart, major blood vessels and eyes (PHACE syndrome). Large lesions over the lower back and buttocks may be associated with spinal cord and kidney abnormalities (LUMBAR or PELVIS syndrome). Small or focal haemangiomas do not require any further formal testing. Haemangiomas affecting large areas of the face require an MRI/MRA of the brain, eye review and a cardiology review with echocardiography. Large lower back or buttock haemangiomas may require an ultrasound of the spinal cord and genitourinary tract followed up by an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) test. Multiple haemangiomas (more than 5) require an ultrasound of the liver to be performed. Haemangiomas near the eye need to be monitored by a paediatric eye surgeon (ophthalmologist), as partially blocked vision can lead to permanent eye damage. Haemangiomas over the lower cheek or chin and neck (the so-called “beard distribution”) will need to be reviewed by an ear nose and throat (ENT) surgeon as haemangiomas can be associated with airway obstruction. The vast majority of small haemangiomas do not need any form of treatment. Small red haemangiomas on cosmetically important sites can be treated with a topical beta blocker such as timolol 0.5% eye drops. Haemangiomas blocking vision or blocking the airway, ulcerated lesions or rapidly growing lesions on cosmetically important sites can be treated with oral medication such as propranolol. Switching off the growth phase of the haemangioma as soon as possible ensures a better cosmetic result, by reducing the risk of scarring and the need for later surgery. Injected and oral steroids are rarely used. Pulsed dye laser may be needed to clear remaining blood vessels at the conclusion of treatment and prior to the child commencing school.

        "Epidermoid Cyst": "Also known as … Sebaceous Cyst, Epidermoid Inclusion Cyst, Infundibular Cyst, Epidermal Cyst, Epidermal Inclusion Cyst What is an Epidermoid Cyst? An epidermoid cyst is a benign walled-off cavity filled with keratin which originates from the hair follicle unit.  Epidermoid cysts are the most common type of cyst. They may be primary or they may arise from disrupted follicular structures due to trauma or comedone formation (blackheads). Multiple cysts may occur in the conjunction with acne vulgaris, Gardner syndrome and in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Tiny superficial epidermoid cysts are known as milia. Epidermoid cysts appear as flesh coloured to yellowish, firm, round nodules of variable size. A central pore or punctum may be present. They are usually symptomless but sometimes discharge a foul smelling, “cheese-like” material. Less frequently, the cysts can be painful due to inflammation or infection. The diagnosis is usually made by a clinical examination. Sometimes a biopsy may be needed.

        "Insect Bite Reactions": "Insects are small animals with six legs and a hard protective outer shell called an exoskeleton. Most insects have wings and antennae. They belong to the Phylum Arthropoda which contains more subgroups (species) than any other grouping of animals. Mosquitoes, flies, ticks and fleas are the main cause of bites and stings. These insects occur worldwide and may transmit diseases. Some insects are found only in certain geographic locations. Most people experience occasional stings and bites but after natural disasters such as floods and storms, the numbers of bites and stings are often greatly increased. The following list shows the main insect groups whose bites can cause reactions in the skin and which may transmit diseases. This group includes sand flies, march flies, the black flies seen in Northern US and Canada and mosquitoes. Some larval flies can invade the skin causing myiasis. Stings by members of this group may cause anaphylaxis. In fact, the stings by this group of insects cause an estimated 25% of all cases of anaphylaxis. The cat flea is the most common cause of problems in humans, followed by dog fleas and sand fleas. Bites from fleas look like groups of red itchy bumps on the lower leg. Some lesions may blister. Fleas can transmit diseases such as typhus. Lice are wingless insects that cause head, body or pubic lice infestations. Scabies is caused by infestation of the surface layer of the skin (epidermis) by Sarcoptes scabei that infests only humans. The insect most frequently burrows into the skin of the web spaces of the hands and around the wrists.  Most, but not all, infected individuals become allergic to the presence of the mite and develop groups of itchy red lumps over time, involving web spaces of hands, on elbows, around the edges of the armpits, around the nipples, buttocks and genital area. The itchiness is frequently worse at night and may interrupt sleep. There are thousands of different mite species that may bite humans. They are widespread in the environment and may be found on domestic dogs and cats, domestic and wild birds, mice, plants, straw, flour and dust. Their bites are often numerous and may cause redness, itching, swelling and blistering of the skin. These are parasites that feed on animal and human blood. The paralysis tick is found along the eastern coastal regions of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and into Tasmania. The bite mainly causes itchy swollen reactions at the site of the tick bite. Some individuals develop anaphylaxis to ticks. Tick paralysis is rare but, when it occurs, it is usually seen in children. Ticks can transmit tick typhus. Although locally acquired Lyme disease cannot be ruled out there is little evidence that it occurs in Australia (See http://www.health.gov.au/lyme-disease for more information). There is a continuing risk for people travelling overseas to places where Lyme disease is regularly seen. Ticks need to be attached for 24 or more hours to transmit disease. Prompt removal is important. These are bloodsucking insects that bite at night producing rows of red swollen lumps where they contact the skin. Irritation of the skin is caused by contact with the stinging hairs on the surface of the caterpillars or their cocoons. Irritation may be persistent if the hairs become embedded in clothing. The funnel web spider is found on the east coast of Australia from southeast Queensland to Tasmania. The Sydney funnel web spider is the most dangerous and is found in Sydney and areas north to Newcastle and south to the Illawarra. Apply a pressure immobilisation bandage if bitten by a funnel web spider to reduce spread of the venom in the tissues. Then, apply a splint to further reduce movement of the limb. Seek medical attention. While many bites and stings cause inflammation with redness, swelling, blistering, itching, soreness or pain at the site of the bite, it may be possible to differentiate between the different insects causing the problem by looking at: With conditions such as scabies and head, body and pubic lice, the history and the clinical pattern of changes in the skin aids diagnosis. Hypersensitivity to insect bites, known as papular urticaria, causes more persistent lesions to develop after mosquito, flea and other bites. These lesions are more frequently seen in children. It may be difficult to identify the causative insect. Local treatments for symptoms of insect bites include: Reapplication times can be influenced by an individual’s activity, climatic conditions and local mosquito populations. Over application of a repellent will not increase protection times. (The above data was sourced from the Department of Entomology, University of Sydney and Westmead Hospital 2011.) Insect control programs include: Seek local knowledge of where insects are found and reduce exposure as much as possible.

        "Papular Urticaria": "Also known as…Insect bite-induced hypersensitivity What is Papular Urticaria? Papular urticaria is a term used to describe hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction to insect bites manifested by recurrent and persistent itchy lumps or fluid filled blisters. Despite its name, papular urticaria is not a true urticaria (a true urticaria has temporary wheeling or hives that resolve within hours). Papular urticaria is generally thought to be the result of an unusual and abnormal hypersensitivity reaction to bites from insects such as mosquitoes, fleas, mites, bedbugs and particularly bird mites. However, it can be nearly impossible to work out what a person is reacting to. The condition can occur at any age but it is seen most often in children 2 to10 years of age. Adults can be affected but at a much lower rate. The condition is related to an individual’s immune response rather than the insect bite itself. Usually only one member of a family is affected. The condition is not contagious. Papular urticarial begins as very itchy, red and swollen lumps. A water filled blister may develop within 1 to 3 days. When it subsides, it may leave a darkened mark. Scratching leads to crusting, bleeding and ulcers. Infections or persistent scarring may occur especially if the area is scratched deeply and repeatedly. Lesions tend to occur in groups or clusters that are symmetrically distributed. The lesions not only appear at the site of insect bites but also on any part of the body, particularly on exposed areas such as the face, forearms and lower legs. Papular urticaria usually persists for weeks or even months, reactivating when new bites occur. Papular urticaria is usually diagnosed based on a skin examination. Features that suggest an insect bite reaction include grouping of red lumps and bumps that correlate with exposure to insect bites. In some cases, a skin biopsy may be needed. Papular urticaria is usually self-limiting which means that children or affected individuals eventually outgrow it, probably through desensitisation after multiple exposures to insect bites. In rare cases, the condition may recur after months or even years. Preventative measures Symptomatic treatments The condition is usually persistent and commonly recurs. However, individuals develop tolerance to insect bites eventually and symptoms will resolve. Further testing or investigations are not necessary and may be overly invasive.

        "What is squamous cell carcinoma?": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most common forms of skin cancer, with only basal cell carcinoma (BCC) occurring more frequently. It starts from cells in the outermost layer of the skin which start to overgrow and potentially spread. SCC can also start from cells on the lips, tongue, lining of the mouth and genitals. ",
        "Who gets squamous cell carcinoma?": "SCC occurs mainly in Caucasians. Individuals who are immunosuppressed such as those who have had an organ transplant or those with conditions such as lymphoma are more prone to developing multiple SCCs. SCC usually occurs in older individuals and is very rare in children and young adults. ",
        "What causes squamous cell carcinoma?": "SCC is caused mainly by chronic sun exposure. It is thought that the ultraviolet light, particularly UVA, from the sun gradually triggers the skin cells to develop into a SCC. This means that most SCCs occur on sun-exposed sites. Sometimes a wart virus can trigger changes in the cells causing a SCC to form, especially on the genitals or inside the mouth. Other cases are caused by exposure to chemicals (such as arsenic or the tar found in cigarette smoke) or due to trauma such as a burn. ",
        "What does squamous cell carcinoma look like?": "SCC can present in many different ways. It often presents as a raised scaly lump on sun-exposed sites commonly found on the backs of the hands, forearms, legs, scalp, ears and lips. SCC can also appear as a crusted sore. On the lips an SCC can present as a persistent small ulcer or thickened firm scaly skin. SCC can develop slowly over years from a red scaly sunspot that slowly thickens and enlarges, to become an intraepidermal carcinoma (Bowen’s disease) which is SCC in the thin top layer of the skin. This may progress further to become a fully developed SCC involving the deeper layers of the skin. SCC can also develop rapidly with the changes occurring over a few months.

SCC on the elbow – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Brad Jones Figure 4. SCC on the forearm – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Brad Jones ",
        "How is squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made clinically based on the appearance or behaviour of the SCC. A small biopsy is often needed to confirm the diagnosis prior to treatment being undertaken. The biopsy helps avoid unnecessary surgery on a benign lesion that may mimic SCC and also determines the type of SCC and subsequent treatment method. ",
        "How is squamous cell carcinoma treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The condition is usually treated with simple skin surgery. This enables the pathologist to check under the microscope that the SCC has been removed completely. Further surgery or radiation therapy may be required if there was any residual tumour evident, or nerves were involved, or a more aggressive pattern was seen under the microscope. In some situations and locations, small SCCs can be treated by a scraping called curettage or by freezing with liquid nitrogen. In cases, where surgery is not appropriate the SCC may be treated by radiation therapy alone. Regular follow-up for monitoring is required. Cemiplimab (immunotherapy agent) is often used by oncologists for metastatic or locally aggressive SCC. Evidence shows that taking a daily Vitamin B3 tablet (nicotinamide) may help lower the incidence of SCCs in high risk individuals. 1 ",
        "What is the likely outcome of squamous cell carcinoma?": "Most SCCs can be easily treated and do not cause any future concerns. However, SCCs have the potential to spread to the lymph nodes and other organs. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Irritant Contact Dermatitis (ICD)": "Also known as…Contact Dermatitis or Skin Irritation What is irritant contact dermatitis (ICD)? Dermatitis is a very common, itchy red skin rash with a variety of types and causes (some types are also called eczema). It is common for a person with dermatitis to have more than one type, either at the same time or at different times in their lives. All forms of dermatitis are caused by particular types of attack by the immune system on the skin. Irritation is different to allergy. Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is caused by repeated exposure to substances that aggravate the skin.  Common examples of such substances are water (such as in repeated hand washing), soaps and detergents, acidic substances, solvents and other industrial chemicals.  Repeated exposure to these substances over time causes a breakdown in the barrier function of the skin, so reduces the skin’s ability to protect itself from these chemicals. As a result, redness, scaling, blistering and splitting are seen in irritant contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is different in that the immune system reacts specifically to contact with an outside protein or chemical (for example an allergy to latex gloves).  Those with irritant hand dermatitis are more at risk of developing allergic contact dermatitis as the breakdown in the skin barrier function allows increased penetration of outside substances into the skin where they can make contact with the immune system. Irritant contact dermatitis varies from a mild dry red slightly itchy and quite localised rash to a severe weeping or blistering (fluid filled bubbles) rash. Some people develop thicker skin prone to splitting. ICD occurs in the area where the offending chemical touches the skin. Any part of the skin can be affected. The hands and feet are commonly affected but ICD can occur on the face or elsewhere on the body. If the chemical is in contact with a large area of skin the rash may be extensive. Contact with strong chemicals such as some acids or alkalis, may cause a rash or chemical burn to appear quickly. On the other hand, repeated contact with milder chemicals may be required to trigger the dermatitis. Once the dermatitis is active, infrequent contact with the chemicals will keep it “grumbling along”. If the rash is worse during the working week and less on weekends or holidays, then a work-related cause may be suspected. Atopic dermatitis (AD), which is associated with the tendency to develop hayfever or asthma, also involves a reduced skin barrier so people with this form of dermatitis are more prone to developing ICD as well as other forms of dermatitis. Allergy tests such as prick tests, RAST tests or patch tests do NOT determine irritation. There is no readily available test to identify chemical causes of ICD. Treatment of ICD requires identifying chemicals and physical factors likely to cause irritation and then avoiding exposure. This requires knowledge of where the offending chemicals are likely to be found. Personal protective measures are an important part of treatment. These include gloves, shoes, appropriate clothing or aprons and safety glasses or goggles. Barrier creams provide some protection. Certain chemicals are better able to penetrate certain gloves or barrier creams so specialist advice may be required. Sweating under gloves or shoes can also be irritating. The rash should slowly clear once exposure is avoided. As people often have more than one type of dermatitis at the same time, avoiding irritants (or allergens)may only settle one part of the problem. Regular use of greasy moisturisers is often beneficial. Short showers, less frequent hand washing and sensible avoidance of soaps and detergents are also needed. Cortisone creams (if sufficiently strong) or tablets will temporarily settle most cases of ACD. Other measures may be needed such as therapy with ultraviolet light, special X-rays or certain medications. The likely outcome depends on how easy it is to avoid irritating chemicals or physical factors. This may be difficult in occupations requiring a lot of wet work such as nursing, cleaning, hairdressing, food industries and metal turning. People with pre-existing atopic dermatitis commonly continue to be prone to ICD.

        "Jessner Lymphocytic Infiltrate": "Also known as … Benign Lymphocytic Infiltration of the skin, Jessner–Kanof Lymphocytic infiltration of the skin What is Jessner Lymphocytic Infiltrate? It is a benign skin condition characterised by persistent lymphocyte (immune) cells in the skin. It may be a variant of lupus erythematosus, but this remains uncertain.  The cause of this condition is unknown. Jessner’s occurs primarily on sun-exposed sites such as the head, neck and upper back. It appears as one or several non-scaly red raised spots, plaques and less commonly larger lumps. Circular lesions with a central clearing are commonly seen. Lesions do not usually cause symptoms, but some affected people experience burning or itching. Individuals are otherwise well and have no internal symptoms. Onset or worsening of lesions following sun exposure commonly occurs. There can be a seasonal variation in severity. As Jessner’s can improve on its own, treatment is often unnecessary. Sun avoidance and sun protection are strongly recommended in all cases, regardless of whether there is a history of photo-aggravation. A variety of treatment options have been tried with variable success rates including: The course of Jessner’s is variable and unpredictable, most often lasting months to years. Lesions may recur at the same site or elsewhere. There are often periods of remission and exacerbation. However, the condition may also resolve completely without treatment.

        "Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa": "Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the main types of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). This group of inherited skin fragility disorders is characterised by blistering of the skin and body linings with minimal injury. There are four main types of EB which are defined by the depth at which the skin becomes blistered. There are two main layers of the skin, the epidermis (the very top layer) and the dermis (the inner layer of skin). In JEB the skin fragility and blistering occurs through the basement membrane zone that lies between the epidermis and the dermis. Approximately 5-10% of people affected with EB have JEB. JEB is a genetic disease. It is caused by a mutation (like a spelling mistake) in one of genes that makes the proteins that hold the skin together. Mutations in this gene cause the proteins to be weak or even absent resulting in skin fragility and blistering with minor injury. JEB is almost exclusively inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This occurs if both parents are carriers of the condition. These parents are often not aware that they are carriers as they do not show physical signs and there may not be a family history of the condition. The birth of a child with JEB is usually completely unexpected. Skin blistering usually appears at birth or in the first few weeks of life. Painful and difficult to heal skin erosions can then develop on the face and nappy areas. Significant ulceration of the mouth, throat and gullet may develop leading to a hoarse voice, poor feeding and failure to thrive. Nails may be absent or grow abnormally. Dental enamel defects and tooth decay are common. Correct diagnosis of the EB type is important as each has different levels of severity and outcomes: There is currently no cure for JEB. The aim of treatment is to reduce the development of new blisters, promote skin healing and prevent infection. Treatments are tailored to the individual. Local treatments for the skin include: Other treatments include: As JEB is a genetic condition, the skin fragility and blistering tendency will persist lifelong. Babies born with the severest from of JEB may die in the first year of life due to complications from severe blistering of the skin and digestive tract such as malnutrition, anaemia and overwhelming infection. Babies born with the milder form of JEB can expect to live into adulthood but may suffer with lifelong pain and disability. There is currently no known cure for JEB, although worldwide research is being conducted to find better treatments for people living with this condition.

        "Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis": "Also known as … Atopic Winter Feet, Forefoot Dermatitis, Moon-boot Foot Syndrome, Sweaty Sock Dermatitis What is Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis? Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis is a skin condition where there is cracking and peeling of the weight-bearing areas of the soles. The condition occurs primarily (but not exclusively) in children who have atopic dermatitis (eczema), asthma or hay fever. Their skin seems more sensitive than the skin of others and friction appears to play a role. Boys aged 3 to 14are most commonly affected. This condition tends to be better in winter when shoes and socks are being worn, deteriorating in summer due to increased friction with the foot moving more in sandals, particularly if sweaty. Wearing socks and shoes made of synthetic material can exacerbate the condition. The soles become shiny and glazed with some scaling, painful cracks and fissures. Sometimes the heel and palms are affected as well. The tops of the feet, the web spaces between the toes and the instep are typically spared. A diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on a medical history and the appearance of the rash. However, investigations such as skin scrapings or patch tests may be needed to distinguish it from other skin conditions (such as psoriasis, keratolysis exfoliativa, contact allergic dermatitis or fungal infection). Prognosis is good as the condition usually resolves by puberty.

        "Juvenile xanthogranuloma": "What is juvenile xanthogranuloma? Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a self-limiting benign condition which means that it resolves spontaneously without treatment. The condition is most common during the first two years of life. It is present at birth in 10% of cases. Males are affected slightly more often than females. JXG belongs to the family of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (a group of conditions made up of histiocyte-type cells) most of which self resolve. What does JXG look like? JXG generally presents as a smooth, pink, brown or yellow lump which may be small or large and which may completely go away over a few years or may leave slightly stretched skin. Most affected people generally have only one of these lesions, but 20% of cases have multiple lesions. Most lesions are found on the head and neck and less commonly on the trunk. It is rare for JXGs to be in other organs. It they are in other organs, the eye is the most common place. What causes JXG? The cause is unknown. What other problems can occur with JXG? Very rarely JXG may be associated with neurofibromatosis-1or chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Lesions on the iris may bleed, producing hyphaema. How is JXG diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made on the appearance of the lesions and tests are generally not required. A biopsy may be needed for atypical cases. An eye exam may be warranted if there are multiple skin lesions. How is JXG treated? Lesions usually heal spontaneously over a period of years, sometimes leaving a slight textural change. Unless there is involvement of the eyes, treatment is not required. Surgical removal or excision of individual skin lesions may be required in rare atypical cases. What is the likely outcome of JXG? JXG tends to settle spontaneously without any further complications and does not recur.

        "Kaposi Sarcoma": "Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a type of disorganised growth of blood vessels. It was first described in 1872 by Moritz Kaposi. KS is caused by an infection with a virus called human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). This virus alters the genes on the cells that line blood vessels and the lymphatic system, causing an increase in division rate and a longer cell-life. As a result, there is an abnormal increase in production of new blood vessels. There are four variants of KS. Classic Type: It is most common type and often seen in older males of Mediterranean or eastern European heritage. Skin lesions are primarily seen on the legs. It usually follows an inactive clinical course. Iatrogenic Type: It appears secondary to the use of immunosuppressive medication, and may be seen in organ transplant recipients. AIDS related KS: Occurs in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It can be disseminated but effective HIV treatment may control the disease. Endemic Type (African): Most commonly seen in African males, the clinical course ranges from slow progression to rapid internal organ dissemination.  There is a variant that affects children with rapid aggressive disease. Lesions appear as painless, bluish-red flat patches on the skin resembling bruises. These lesions may increase in size progressively and form plaques and nodules. With enough time, they may become brown, and the skin may thicken or form ulcers.  In some cases, KS may spread to other parts of the body. There are many growths of the blood vessels which may look like KS such as tufted angioma, Kaposiform haemangioendothelioma and bacillary angiomatosis. In order to make a definitive diagnosis, a skin biopsy. KS is a difficult condition to treat. In many patients, obtaining a complete cure may be difficult and recurrence rates are high. Nevertheless, lesions may have a significant impact on quality of life and self-esteem and there are treatment options available. The treatment alternatives for KS depend on the clinical type, the extent and location, and which organ system is involved. For KS confined to the skin, the treatment options include: On the other hand, for widespread skin lesions, stubborn lesions or in the setting of internal organ involvement, systemic treatment may be a better option. For patients with KS and changes to their immune system (either through immune-suppressing medications or the HIV virus), improving the function of the immune system can help treating the KS.

        "Kawasaki’s disease": "Previously known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome What is Kawasaki’s disease? Kawasaki’s disease is a rare form of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels). It can affect many parts of the body. The diagnosis is made when someone has a high fever and the typical changes in the skin, eyes, mouth and lymph nodes. It is a serious condition as it may affect the heart. What causes Kawasaki’s disease? The cause of Kawasaki’s disease is unknown. One theory is that it may be triggered by an infection. However, this has not been proven and antibiotics are not needed. The condition is not contagious. Asian people, particularly Japanese boys, are more likely to be affected which suggests a genetic predisposition to the condition. What does Kawasaki’s disease look like? Kawasaki’s disease is more common in children. Most cases occur in children under 2 years of age. All those affected with Kawasaki’s disease have a fever (up to 40°C) that continues for at least 5 days. Other features include: At least four of these features (known as the diagnostic criteria) are needed to diagnose Kawasaki’s disease. People with fever and less than four features may be diagnosed with “incomplete Kawasaki’s disease”. It can be difficult to make the diagnosis as features may develop at different times. There are also similar changes caused by many infections, as well as reactions to medications and some forms of arthritis. What other problems can occur with Kawasaki’s disease? Other areas of the body can be affected, causing sore joints, headaches, diarrhoea and vomiting. The most serious complication is heart disease, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), aneurysms (dilation of blood vessels) and damage to the heart valves. How is Kawasaki’s disease diagnosed? There is no test to diagnose Kawasaki’s disease. It is diagnosed based on the appearance of the condition and whether this meets the diagnostic criteria listed above. Investigations may be needed to exclude other infections. When Kawasaki’s disease is considered, it is very important to check which areas of the body are involved. Blood tests, an ECG (heart tracing) and echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) may be needed. How is Kawasaki’s disease treated? People with Kawasaki’s disease are usually treated in hospital. The goals of treatment are to manage fever and pain and to reduce inflammation and potentially long term damage to the blood vessels. Immunoglobulin is given into the veins. A high dose of aspirin is given, usually continuing for two months. Long-term follow up by a cardiologist is recommended. What is the likely outcome of Kawasaki’s disease? Affected people usually recover from the condition in 1 to 2 months. Without treatment, 20% of cases have heart damage and some may die. With appropriate treatment, the risk of permanent heart damage is less than 5%.

        "Keloids": "What are keloids? Keloids are a type of scar of the skin that has too much collagen and scar tissue formation. Keloids occur after injury to the skin and are more common on the upper chest, upper back and shoulders. People with coloured skin (skin of colour) have a higher risk of developing keloids. Keloids may be large and disfiguring and can cause significant distress. What causes keloids? The cause of keloid formation is still not fully known. Excessive collagen (protein made in wound repair) formation occurs in areas of injury to the skin. The injury does not have to be major for a keloid to form. Injury to the skin includes burns, cuts, tattoos, injection sites, ear piercings, vaccinations or surgery.  Keloids may also occur as a result of inflammation in the skin (such as in acne, insect bites or abscesses) or in areas of increased skin tension or tightness. Keloids typically develop slowly and usually appear months after the skin injury. Keloid formation is rarely spontaneous (without an injury). Keloids develop in those who are susceptible or prone to developing this type of scar. Who is more at risk of developing a keloid? There is a higher risk of developing a keloid scar if a person: What do keloids look like? Keloids appear in all shapes and sizes and are essentially large scars. They are firm, smooth and shiny, and may be pink, red, brown or skin coloured.  Keloids occur most commonly on the earlobes, upper chest, upper back and shoulder region, but they can occur anywhere on the body. Keloids may cause itch, pain and a pulling or tight sensation. Movement may be restricted at the site of the keloid . Keloids are different to hypertrophic scars, which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound. Keloids, on the other hand, grow beyond the original area of injury and tend to be more permanent compared to hypertrophic scars. What other problems can occur with keloids? There are no internal problems or medical complications associated with this benign (harmless) condition. Keloids do not turn into cancer. How are keloids diagnosed? A doctor can usually diagnose this condition by looking at the skin. A skin biopsy may be required in some cases. How are keloids treated? It is best  to aim to prevent keloid formation if possible.  Keloids are often difficult to treat once they have occurred. Keloids can be prevented by avoiding unnecessary surgery (e.g. cosmetic surgery), tension and injury to the skin (e.g. tattoos, body piercings) and by taking some precautions in those who are at high risk of developing keloids. Conditions that have a high risk of scarring (e.g. acne) increase the risk of keloid formation and should therefore be treated as early as possible to try to prevent keloids from forming. Most treatment options for keloids aim to flatten and improve the appearance of the keloid and reduce associated  symptoms. Some form of scar will usually still be visible on the skin after treatment. Treatment options for keloids include: In general, cutting the keloid out (i.e. surgery) often results in a larger keloid scar, unless the surgery is combined with other techniques (e.g. intralesional steroids, radiotherapy) or the surgeon is able to successfully reduce the tension on the wound.

        "Keratoacanthoma": "What is keratoacanthoma? Keratoacanthoma is a skin tumour that develops on sun damaged skin. It is often difficult to distinguish it from a more aggressive lookalike, a squamous cell cancer (SCC). What causes keratoacanthoma? The cause of keratoacanthoma is unknown.  It most frequently occurs on the sun exposed skin of the head and neck, arms and legs and is more common in fair sun-damaged individuals or people whose immune system is suppressed by disease or treatment (such as transplant patients). Keratoacanthoma is thought to be a less aggressive form of squamous cell cancer that may resolve without treatment over a period of some months. As it is very difficult to distinguish between an early keratoacanthoma and squamous cell cancer, most are biopsied or excised (removed), as squamous cell cancer, if left untreated, may spread to regional lymph nodes. There are rare genetic conditions in which people experience large numbers of keratoacanthomas. What does keratoacanthoma look like? It usually develops as a single, rapidly growing, often tender, round red pimple-like lump that develops a central crater which becomes filled with a hard scaly core.  Gradually, after some weeks of growth, the edges may start to flatten and the scaly core may fall out leaving a saucer-like scar.  In the early rapid growth period the lump is often sore and tender. What other problems can also occur with keratoacanthoma? Most keratoacanthomas are about 5 to15 mm in diameter, but some may be several centimetres in diameter or there can be multiple grouped growths. This can make treatment more difficult. How is keratoacanthoma diagnosed? The diagnosis is often suspected clinically from their appearance, but because the early rapid growth phase closely resembles a squamous cell carcinoma, a biopsy or excision (surgical removal) is usually performed. The histopathology of these two tumours can also be extremely difficult to distinguish so often complete removal is preferable. How is keratoacanthoma treated? It is surgically excised (removed) where this is possible. If an individual cannot have surgery then radiotherapy or injections of chemotherapeutic agents into the tumour can be used successfully. In people who develop multiple keratoacanthomas (such as a transplant patient or a badly sun damaged individual), an oral retinoid medication may be prescribed to reduce the number of skin cancers developing. Acitretin is the drug of choice and is effective in reducing new keratoacanthomas from developing. The individual must protect their skin from the sun by wearing appropriate protective clothing and regularly applying a SPF50 or SPF50+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen when outdoors. Regular skin checks are necessary to look for new keratoacanthomas and other forms of sun induced skin cancers.

        "Keratoderma climactericum": "Also known as Haxthausen disease What is keratoderma climactericum? There are many forms of keratoderma which is the term given to the development of harmless skin thickening on the soles, particularly the heels. Keratoderma climactericum refers to the form that occurs during the menopausal period. What causes keratoderma climactericum? Keratoderma climactericum occurs more commonly in women of menopausal age with no personal or family history of skin diseases. Hormonal imbalance may play a role as well as obesity, hypertension, cold dry climates and wearing backless shoes, e.g. sandals. What does it look like? Skin thickening (hyperkeratosis) and redness (erythema) begin over pressure points on the heels and forefeet. As the hyperkeratosis extends, cracks (fissures) form that make walking painful.

        "Palmoplantar keratoderma": "Also known as keratosis palmaris et plantaris What is palmoplantar keratoderma? Palmoplantar keratoderma is the name given to a group of conditions where there is abnormal thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Palmoplantar keratoderma is classified based on whether it is inherited or acquired and on its clinical features. Inherited palmoplantar keratodermas are classified into four different groups: 1)      Diffuse\n2)      Focal\n3)      Punctate\n4)      Transgradient Acquired keratodermas are not inherited and can be categorised based on various causes, as explained below. What causes palmoplantar keratoderma? There are many possible causes for acquired palmoplantar keratodermas including drugs, menopause, chemicals (e.g. arsenic), mechanical stimulation, malnutrition, systemic conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, circulatory disorders), malignancies (e.g. lung cancer, colon cancer, lymphomas), skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema, pityriasis rubra pilaris, lupus erythematosus) and infectious causes (e.g. syphilis, tuberculosis, human papilloma virus). When the condition is inherited, family members will have the same type of palmoplantar keratoderma. Autosomal dominant keratodermas are likely to affect every generation of a family. However, in autosomal recessive keratodermas parents are “carriers” of the defective gene (meaning that they don’t show the disorder on their skin) but may pass it onto their children if both parents are “carriers”. Most inherited cases of the condition are caused by a defective gene producing keratin 9. What does palmoplantar keratoderma look like? In diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, the skin on the palms and or soles appears thickened and may be hard, yellowish in colour. It affects the entire palm or sole. In focal palmoplantar keratoderma, usually only pressure or friction points are affected. In punctate palmoplantar keratoderma there are tiny skin spots on the palms and soles. Transgradient palmoplantar keratoderma is rare. The condition extends onto the backs of the hands or feet. How is palmoplantar keratoderma diagnosed? Palmoplantar keratoderma is diagnosed by a detailed medical history and physical examination. When the condition is severe and hereditary keratoderma is suspected, the affected person maybe referred to a geneticist for further testing. What other problems can occur with palmoplantar keratoderma? Individuals may experience pain when walking, foot odour, excessive sweating or maceration (moist, white and peeling) of the soles or between the toes. Fungal infections and reduced sensation of the fingers or toes may also be present. The condition may also be associated with changes in nails, hair or teeth. Those affected with keratoderma may also suffer psychological stress due to the appearance of their skin. How is palmoplantar keratoderma treated? Inherited palmoplantar keratodermas are not curable but symptoms can be controlled. The aim of treatment is to reduce the thickness of the skin and to soften the skin. Treatment options include regular use of emollients, keratolytics such as salicylic acid or urea, antifungal cream or tablets if indicated, topical retinoids/calcipotriol and systemic retinoids. Regular visits to a podiatry service for physical removal of thickened skin may be recommended, as well as the wearing of an appropriate shoe with customised insoles. Acquired keratodermas will require additional treatment of the underlying cause. What is the likely outcome of palmoplantar keratoderma? Symptoms can be well-managed if suggested treatments are complied with. Regular follow-up with a doctor is important to monitor skin irritation or other adverse effects associated with treatment. Regular blood tests may be required when using oral antifungals and retinoids.  Women of reproductive age should avoid using retinoids and oral antifungals without appropriate contraception.

        "Keratosis pilaris": "What is it? Keratosis pilaris is a common but harmless condition that results in rough, bumpy spots on the upper arms and thighs. It is most common in adolescence but can also occur in children and adults. It occurs to some degree in approximately 50 to 80% of adolescents. What causes it? Keratosis pilaris is, in most cases, a genetic condition that runs in families. The skin cells that line the hair follicles are sticky and form a plug of dry skin. Many bumps also contain an ingrown hair. It is more common in people with a tendency towards eczema (atopic dermatitis). What does it look like? Keratosis pilaris varies in severity from a few small bumps to widespread involvement. It most commonly affects the upper arms and thighs although it can also be seen on the face and back. In some cases, the bumps can be quite red (keratosis pilaris rubra). The appearance of this condition is often more obvious in winter due to lower humidity levels and consequent drying of the skin. How is it diagnosed? Keratosis pilaris is diagnosed during a clinical examination by a dermatologist who observes  the typical appearance of the rash. Further investigations are not usually needed. How is it treated? There is no cure for this condition. However, it often improves over time. Keratosis pilaris is harmless so no specific treatment is needed. However, people affected with this condition often want to improve the appearance of the skin. Treatment is directed towards increasing the moisture of the skin and removing the bumps. Moisturisers and regular but gentle exfoliation are the most commonly used forms of treatment. Creams containing urea, salicylic acid, lactic acid or glycolic acid may also be used. Other reported treatments include topical retinoids (vitamin A) and vitamin D creams. Vascular laser or IPL might be considered in keratosis pilaris rubra although the response to these treatments is variable.

Keratosisi pilaris can affect anyone at all ages, but it is most common in children and adolescents. Approximately 50-80% of adolescents are affected to some degree. The cheeks are involved more commonly in children. It is more common in individuals who suffer from atopic dermatitis (eczema) or ichthyosis vulgaris. Keratosis pilaris is, in most cases, a genetic condition that runs in families. Hair follicle openings become plugged with a build-up of keratin, a protein that lines the hair and skin. Some of the bumps may contain an ingrown hair. A group of small, rough, red bumps on the cheeks, resembling chicken skin with a prominent background pinkish-red discoloration. In severe cases the bumps may have a tiny pustule. It appears worse in the winter months due to low humidity and consequent drying of the skin.

The post- inflammatory healing phase with redness or brown hyperpigmentation is also seen. The acne lesions are often tender and long lasting. Many women affected with adult acne experience a flare-up of their acne the week prior to their menstrual cycle. ",
        "How is adult acne diagnosed?": "Adult acne is diagnosed clinically by observing the presence of whiteheads, blackheads, red pumps, and pimples and inflamed pus-filled spots on the face, chest or back. In some cases, further blood or imaging investigations may be needed if there are suspected hormonal abnormalities or signs of insulin resistance. ",
        "How is adult acne treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Adult acne treatment is the same as for acne vulgaris, and may include: In adult acne cases that are resistant to treatment, long-term low dose oral isotretinoin may be prescribed by dermatologists. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of adult acne?": "Adult acne is often characterised by flare-ups and acne-free periods. This may continue for several years but can usually be suppressed with treatment. Adult acne can be persistent for many years into a person’s 30s and 40s. In severe acne, scarring can develop because of deeper, more severe inflammation or pus-filled spots. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Leg ulcers": "What are leg ulcers? Leg ulcers are extremely common and occur more frequently in elderly people. In countries with developed health systems, 1-3% of the total health budget is spent on treating leg ulcers. An ulcer is a defect in the skin or mucous membranes, similar to a wound. While wounds can be superficial or deep, ulcers by definition are always deep. When ulcers heal, they usually leave a scar. By contrast, erosion refers to a more superficial wound which heals without leaving a scar. What causes leg ulcers? There are multiple causes of leg ulceration. The most common cause is venous disease. Other causes include: Venous ulcers and varicose veins Venous ulcers are the most common chronic wounds in humans. Venous ulcers are caused by venous hypertension (high blood pressure in the leg veins). Chronic varicose veins or a previous deep vein thrombosis can result in venous hypertension. Venous ulcers are usually accompanied by other clinical signs of venous disease such as swelling, pigmentation, varicose dermatitis, atrophie blanche and lipodermatosclerosis. High blood pressure in the leg veins causes leakage of fluid from the abnormal veins into the surrounding tissues. This leads to swelling, especially around the ankles. Leakage of red blood cells leads to iron staining and skin pigmentation in the lower legs. The subsequent inflammation will result in varicose eczema and may lead to scarring (known as atrophie blanche) and hardening of the skin and fat (known as lipodermatosclerosis) in affected areas. This will eventually lead to skin breakdown and ulceration. Dressings have a limited role in the management of venous ulcers and compression is needed to control the underlying venous hypertension. If the underlying veins need to be treated, the ideal treatment in elderly people involves non-invasive techniques such as endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and foam sclerotherapy to achieve long-term healing. Surgery may be necessary in selected cases. Leg elevation, compression stockings and occasional, intermittent pneumatic compression pumps should be used to prevent recurrence. Arterial ulcers and peripheral vascular disease Arterial ulcers are less common than venous ulcers. They are more common in men, smokers and people with diabetes. In some people, leg ulcers may be related to both arterial and venous diseases being present at the same time. These ulcers are caused by lack of normal blood flow to the tissues. Leg arteries that carry blood to the tissues are partially or completely blocked. Risk factors include atherosclerosis (the same process that leads to heart attacks and strokes), high blood pressure, smoking and diabetes. Blocked arteries need to be re-opened or by-passed whenever possible to allow enough blood to reach the target tissues. Angioplasty or bypass operations may be required to re-constitute the blood flow. Compression in such cases may be counterproductive. Neuropathic ulcers People with diabetes develop peripheral neuropathy. This results in a loss of sensation in a “glove and sock” distribution. Affected individuals may not be aware of trauma to the foot and develop ulcers in the traumatised areas. Other causes There are other causes of leg ulcers such as skin conditions (eg. pyoderma gangrenosum), infections and malignant tumours. A biopsy may be needed to identify the exact cause so that it can be treated appropriately. How are leg ulcers managed? The most important first step in the management of leg ulcers is making the correct diagnosis. Ulcers can be caused by a range of conditions which each require very different treatment strategies. Photographs and measurements of the ulcer’s size and depth should be taken over time to monitor progress. Blood tests may be necessary to investigate associated conditions such as diabetes. Skin biopsies may be needed to exclude rare causes such as tumours, vasculitis and infections. Ulcers may need to be swabbed from time to time and infections treated appropriately. Ultrasound studies are required to establish the status of the underlying venous and arterial systems and plan treatment. X-rays, MRI and other imaging investigations may be required to exclude unusual underlying causes or associated problems such as osteomyelitis. It is important to consult health professionals who are skilled in managing leg ulcers. Wet and moist ulcers require daily change of dressings whereas dry ulcers require moist dressings. Excessive moisture will impede the healing of most ulcers. Different types of dressings may be needed depending on the status of the ulcer (wet/dry/infected). Compression is very important in the management of venous ulcers but may need to be avoided in arterial ulcers. The underlying condition should be identified and treated. With venous ulcers, the underlying veins should be treated. With conditions such as pyoderma gangrenosum, the ulcer responds to appropriate treatment of the underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Referrals to specialist centres will be required when dealing with non-healing recalcitrant ulcers.

        "Leg Veins": "Normal circulation In a healthy individual, blood leaves the heart and is pumped through the arteries to reach the organs of the body. Blood flowing through the arteries provides oxygen and nutrition to the body. Nutrients and oxygen leave the circulation to reach the tissues via small vessels called ‘capillaries’. Therefore arteries are responsible for the ‘supply’ aspect of blood circulation. Unwanted waste material and fluid from tissues is then collected in small vessels called ‘venules’. Multiple venules join to form veins. Veins have the task of taking the blood back to the heart so it can eventually go through the lungs to get more oxygen. Therefore veins are responsible for the ‘drainage’ aspect of circulation. Once oxygenated in the lungs, blood flows from the lung back to the heart and the cycle continues. Healthy veins Normal healthy veins act as a ‘one-way pipe’ for blood to flow back to the heart. While the heart acts as a pump for arteries, veins rely on muscle contraction as a pump. For example, blood has to be pumped up against gravity in the leg veins. To pump the blood up the leg veins, the foot, calf and thigh muscles have to contract.  Walking, swimming, running and other leg exercises involve muscle contraction and provide a good pump for leg veins. There are one-way valves every few centimetres in the leg veins. In healthy veins, these valves allow the one-way flow of blood back to the heart. Following a muscle contraction, blood is pumped up the vein through the valves. Valve cusps open to let the blood get through during the muscle contraction. When the muscles relax, blood rushes back down towards the valve due to gravity. In healthy veins, valve cusps close tightly to prevent backflow during muscle relaxation. With the next contraction, blood will go further up in the vein until it eventually reaches the heart. Abnormal veins Abnormal veins have weak walls. Valves in abnormal veins do not close properly resulting in backflow or ‘reflux’ in the affected vein. Blood in these veins leaks through the abnormal valves and flows in the opposite direction due to gravity. In abnormal leg veins, blood flows back towards the feet rather than going back to the heart. With no leg movement, blood will not flow up the veins and will sit in the veins, stagnant, and eventually leak out. Varicose veins Abnormal veins accumulate too much blood and eventually bulge out as ‘varicose’ veins. Excess blood is forced back into capillaries which enlarge to form ‘spider veins’. So spider veins may be indicative of underlying ‘feeding’ varicose veins. Varicose veins may have no symptoms at all but symptoms can include aches and pains in the lower limbs, heaviness, and burning, throbbing, cramping and restless legs. Symptoms are often worse at the end of the day and after prolonged standing but better by the next morning when patients wake up. Risk Factors Risk factors for developing varicose veins include aging, standing occupations, obesity, lack of mobility, previous blood clots (venous thrombosis) and leg injury. A definitive cause is not known, however a strong family history of varicose veins is a common finding. Varicose veins and spider veins in women worsen with hormone fluctuations during puberty, pregnancy, menopause and with the use of birth control pills. Long-term Problems In time, fluid collects around the ankles causing ankle swelling. As matters get worse, blood leaks out from the veins causing pigmentation, venous eczema and eventually extensive scarring. Ultimately, skin can break down causing leg ulceration. In rare cases, ulcers can turn cancerous over time. Stagnant blood in varicose veins can clot (superficial thrombophlebitis, STP). Such clots can enter the deep veins (deep vein thrombosis, DVT). Clots can travel to the lungs in rare cases causing pulmonary embolism (PE) which is a life threatening condition. How are leg veins diagnosed? Ultrasoundinvestigations (venous mapping) can accurately assess normal and abnormal veins to help determine the cause, severity and extent of the problem. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) scans and blood tests may also be required if the individual has a personal or family history of blood clots. These investigations are required to determine the most appropriate course of treatment. How are leg veins treated? General measures People with varicose veins should avoid prolonged standing. Occupations such as hairdressing or factory work that require prolonged periods of standing should be avoided. Walking and exercise are good for the blood flow in the veins. Graduated compression stockings should be worn during long-haul flights and when standing for prolonged periods. Surgery Surgery was historically the only method to treat varicose veins. It is now mostly reserved for advanced cases where the less invasive methods may not be suitable. It may involve pulling out the saphenous trunk (stripping), removal of branch veins through multiple cuts (avulsions) and tying off the ends of the vein (ligation). It is usually performed in a hospital under general anaesthesia and may require a few days off work. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) EVLA and RFA are minimally invasive procedures to treat saphenous veins. Saphenous veins are considered ‘trunks’ and other superficial veins are considered tributaries (branches). These procedures involve insertion of a laser or radiofrequency fibre in the saphenous vein near the ankles or the knees. The fibre is then advanced in the vein to reach the highest part. As the device is activated, the fibre is retracted while ablating (closing off) the saphenous vein. This procedure is performed under ultrasound guidance and does not require general anaesthesia. The down-time is minimal and most people go back to work the next day. Ultrasound guided sclerotherapy (UGS) Following the treatment of saphenous veins, UGSis performed to treat the remaining tributaries (branch veins) and visible varicose veins. Deeper underlying veins are identified on ultrasound and injected with a foam sclerosant.  Foam sclerosants are specific drugs designed to close off blood vessels. This procedure is performed in the doctor’s office and does not require general anaesthesia. UGS requires no down-time. Ambulatory phlebectomy (AP) AP is a less invasive form of surgery to remove visible varicose veins. It is performed in the doctor’s office under local anaesthetic.  Small incisions are made in the skin and veins are pulled out using small hooks. AP is an alternative treatment to UGS. Sclerotherapy This procedure involves injection of a sclerosant into abnormal veins using a fine needle. Sclerotherapy is reserved for treating small visible varicose veins and spider veins. This procedure is performed in the doctor’s office and usually causes minimal discomfort. Sclerotherapy is considered the gold standard in the treatment of spider veins. Vascular lasers & intense pulse light (IPL) These methods are best used to treat birthmarks (port-wine stains) or small capillaries on the face. Vascular laser treatment and IPL should not be used to treat leg veins as these methods do not address the underlying problems.

        "Lentigo Maligna": "Also known as… Hutchinson’s Melanotic Freckle What is Lentigo Maligna? Lentigo maligna is an early form of melanoma. In lentigo maligna the cancer cells are confined to the upper layer of the skin (epidermis). When the cancer cells spread deeper into the skin (to dermis) it is called lentigo maligna melanoma. Lentigo maligna occurs most commonly in sun damaged areas such as the face and neck in fair skinned people over the age of 60. The lesion grows slowly in size over a number of years. Melanoma is a potentially lethal disease and lentigo maligna should be diagnosed and excised as soon as possible. The cause of lentigo maligna is sun exposure or solarium use. Factors that predispose a person to developing lentigo maligna or associated condition include: Lentigo maligna commonly looks like a freckle, age spot, sun spot or brown patch that slowly changes shape and grows in size.  The spot may be large in size, irregularly shaped with a smooth surface, and of multiple shades of brown and sometimes other colours. Thickening of part of the lesion, increasing number of colours, ulceration or bleeding can be markers that the lesion is changing into a lentigo maligna melanoma. Lentigo maligna is diagnosed clinically by a dermatologist, sometimes with the help of a dermatoscope (a tool used to magnify and look closely at skin moles). The lesion may be difficult to distinguish from a benign, non-cancerous lesion.  If the lesion is suspect, the doctor will biopsy or remove it to confirm the diagnosis. There are a few ways of treating lentigo maligna including: Lentigo maligna is usually removed by surgical excision with an appropriate margin around the lesion for the best outcome. More specialised surgery or other investigations may be needed in some cases. In cases where surgical excision cannot be performed (lesion is too large, surgery will be too deforming or contraindicated), other treatment methods include radiotherapy, cryotherapy and imiquimod cream.  Then close monitoring of the lesion is required. Lentigo maligna has a good prognosis when detected early and treated appropriately.  However, a small percentage of lesions may be undetected and progress to become an invasive melanoma which is potentially life-threatening. Regular follow-up and full skin examinations are need with the treating doctor to review past treatment sites and monitor areas of suspicion.

        "Leprosy": "Also known as Hansen’s disease What is leprosy? Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by the organism Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin and the nerves. It may also affect mucous membranes (such as the nose) as well as eyes and testicles. Long standing leprosy may cause limb deformities as well. The manifestation the disease takes largely depends on the person’s immune response to the bacterium. Leprosy is one of the oldest diseases known to mankind. It was often referred to in the Bible and was recognised in the ancient civilizations of China, Egypt and India. Throughout history, infected people have often been ostracised by their communities. Consequently they often hid their condition and avoided seeking treatment to avoid discrimination. In fact, the major form of treatment before effective drugs became available was forcible isolation and incarceration. Leprosy is a worldwide condition.  The majority of cases occur in Asia, South America and Africa but leprosy also occurs in the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and Australia. What causes leprosy? It is an air-borne infection spread from person to person. Although large numbers of people are exposed to the bacteria in endemic areas, only a small number go on to develop the disease. Usually long-term close contact is necessary for this to occur. The disease has a very long incubation period from 1 year to 20 years or even longer. It is not highly infectious and genetic factors are thought to be the main risk factor. About 95% of the population may be naturally immune. What does leprosy look like? In a large majority of affected people the first sign of the disease is feeling a numbness which may precede any skin lesions by a number of years. Temperature is the first sensation lost, followed by light touch, pain and then deep pressure. The first skin lesion is usually of indeterminate type, which causes one or more de-pigmented (pale) spots before spontaneous resolution or evolving into the borderline, tuberculoid or lepromatous types of leprosy. Main forms of leprosy Tuberculoid leprosy Borderline leprosy Lepromatous leprosy How is leprosy diagnosed? Leprosy has very characteristic clinical features but the diagnosis must be confirmed because of the need for prolonged treatment. Tests include a skin biopsy, showing characteristic granulomata and involvement of the nerves.  Special staining of the tissue may show acid fast bacilli, the number visible depending on the type of leprosy. In lepromatous leprosy, numerous Mycobacterium leprae bacilli may be found on smears taken from skin slits madein the ear lobes. However, the smears may be negative in the tuberculoid or indeterminate forms of the disease. How is leprosy treated? Management of leprosy is aimed at treating the infection and minimising potential physical deformities. The choice of antibiotics depends on the type of leprosy being treated. The forms of leprosy with fewer bacilli (paucibacillary leprosy) often respond well to rifampicin and dapsone – for 6 months. The more severe lepromatous form of leprosy (multibacillary leprosy) requires the addition of clofazimine and treatment for 12 months or longer. If a certain drug cannot be given due to allergy or other side effects, ofloxacin or clarithromycin are considered as substitutes.  Leprosy is not usually treated with a single drug alone, due to the risk of development of drug resistance. Oral steroids and/or thalidomide are helpful in preventing nerve damage. Surgery may be necessary to reconstruct a collapsed nose, decompression of a nerve abscess, or in managing limb deformities. Patient education is paramount. Leprosy can be cured but it is essential to take the full course of medication. Affected people become non infections soon after commencement of treatment. As such, affected people should not be isolated. Physical, social and psychological rehabilitation is necessary for those whose disease has been neglected. Reactions to leprosy treatment These are known as lepra reactions and are due to changes in the immune system. There are two types of lepra reactions: It is important to understand that leprosy is not a rare disease with at least 200,000 cases worldwide annually, including Australia. With appropriate treatment, leprosy is eminently curable.

        "Pediculosis": "Also known as lice What is pediculosis? Pediculosis is the medical term for an infection or infestation with lice which are blood feeding parasites. What causes pediculosis? Lice do not jump or fly from person to person but require direct contact for transfer. They cannot be transmitted via animals. They can be transferred by some objects and clothing such as hats, combs and sheets. The three lice species that infest humans are: How does it present? Intense itch is the usual symptom but the degree of itch does vary among individuals. With the first infestation, it may take 2 to 6 weeks before itching starts. In repeat infestations, itching develops within the first 24 to 48 hours. In some people, infestations do not produce symptoms. Body lice: The body louse causes night time itch, particularly in the underarms, trunk and groin regions (i.e. areas most often covered by clothing). Nits are rarely found on the individual’s skin as the louse lives primarily on the clothing.\nBites present as tiny red lumps with a red base. Crusts and scratches are occasionally complicated by bacterial infections and lymph node enlargement.\n\n\nPubic lice: The lice are most often found within the pubic hair. However, they can spread to other hairy parts of the body. Eyelashes or eyebrows can also be infested.\nBlood specks on underclothes and live lice may be seen moving in the pubic hair. Tiny bleeding spots or bite marks, scratches, secondary bacterial infection and enlarged lymph glands may be present. When the eyelashes are affected, dark flecks can form that look like mascara. Blue spots may be visible at feeding sites.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\nDiagnosis of infestation requires identification of a live louse and/or a viable nit under the microscope. It is easier to identify and remove live lice by wet combing using a lice comb.\nWhat other problems can occur with pediculosis?\n\nItching commonly leads to excoriations (scratch marks) and secondary bacterial infection.\nUpon diagnosis of pubic lice a screen for other STDs should be done\nIn some countries the body louse transmits diseases such as epidemic typhus, trench fever and louse-borne relapsing fever.\n\nHow is pediculosis treated?\nGeneral considerations and prevention\n\nAll people infested with lice in a household and their infested close contacts and bedmates should be treated at the same time.\nItems used by the infested person must be machine washed with hot water and tumble dried.\nItems that cannot be laundered can be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for 2 weeks.\nThe floors and furniture should be vacuumed. However, the risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a rug, carpet or furniture is very small.\nChildren should be taught not to share combs, brushes, hair accessories and towels.\nSoak combs and brushes in hot water (at least 60°C) for 5 to10 minutes.\nDead nits may continue to adhere to hairs and this does not imply treatment failure.\nNits can be removed with a comb designed specifically for that purpose. Use of a hair conditioner makes wet-combing easier. It is best done after treating with anti-lice insecticides. Repeat the combing at least twice more on consecutive nights if possible and then at least weekly until no lice are found on 3 consecutive occasions.\nWhen head lice are detected, notify the child’s school of the infestation. It is not necessary to exclude children from school after the initial treatment of head lice.\nIndividuals with pubic louse infestation should be advised to avoid close body contact until they and their current sexual partner(s) have completed treatment and follow-up.\nShaving pubic hair is beneficial as well as applying topical treatment to all hairy parts of the body apart from the eyelids and scalp. Any remaining nits should be removed by using a fine toothed comb.\nUse of a topical treatment is usually unnecessary with body louse infestation because the lice live on clothing. Treatment of clothing, bed linens and education about hygiene is most important.\n\nTopical agents\n\nIt is important to read the instructions before applying the treatment to ensure that the medication has been left on for the appropriate amount of time and washed off properly.\nNot all eggs are killed with one application of topical medicine, therefore a second application is recommended 7 to10 days later (the time needed for the eggs to hatch).\nVarious topical pediculicidal agents are available: Pyrethrum shampoos and permethrin 1% are available over the counter; permethrin 5%, malathion 0.5% (Ovide®), lindane, topical ivermectin (Sklice®), and spinosad are prescription agents.\nOcclusive products offer an alternative to pediculicides and include:  benzyl alcohol lotion 5%, and 4% dimethicone lotion.\nOther occlusive treatments include vinegar, mayonnaise, petroleum jelly, olive oil, butter, etc. However, most of these have not been scientifically evaluated.\nThe same pediculicides used for head louse infestation are also used for pubic and body louse infestation\nEyelash infestation can be treated effectively with ophthalmic-grade petrolatum.\n\nOral agents\nIvermectin is an option for individuals whose disease is resistant to topical therapies.\nWhat happens when head lice treatment fails?\nFailure to eradicate lice is a common and frustrating problem. There may be a number of reasons for this:\n\nRe-infestation from another person or from contaminated clothes, hats, etc.\nResistance of lice to insecticides or improperly applied treatment. If a course of one kind of insecticide treatment fails, a different insecticide may be selected for the next course.\nIncorrect diagnosis of inactive infection. It is important to look for active lice not just nits.\n\nThis information has been written by Dr Davin Lim and Dr Heba Jibreal\nUpdated 2 November 2015 Bites present as tiny red lumps with a red base.

        "Lichen Planopilaris": "Also known as … Follicular Lichen Planus Lichen Planopilaris (LPP) is a rare inflammatory scalp disorder characterised by scarring Alopecia (permanent hair loss) with several different patterns. The condition is considered to be a form of Lichen Planus which affects the hair follicles. Although the physiopathology is unclear, it is generally accepted that Lichen Planopilaris has an autoimmune cause (Lymphocyte-predominant Inflammatory Infiltrate) with follicular destruction and permanent hair loss. LPP is characterised by redness and inflammation of the hair follicles (Perifollicular Erythema), scaling (Follicular Hyperkeratosis) and permanent hair loss. Individuals may not have any symptoms or they may experience scalp itching and burning. There are three types of Lichen Planopilaris: The three types are distinguished mainly by the pattern of involvement. Patchy scalp involvement is a common presentation of classic LLP. Band-like alopecia involving the frontal scalp and eyebrows is typical of FFA. GLPLS is characterised by three distinctive features – scarring alopecia on the scalp, non-scarring Alopecia in the armpit and groin and widespread scaly or Keratotic Lichenoid Follicular Papules. The diagnosis of LPP is based upon the clinical examination and biopsy results. Proper selection of the biopsy site is crucial. Additionally, careful examination of the mouth, nails and skin may reveal evidence of lichen planus elsewhere. Managing the condition is often quite challenging as relapse after treatment is common. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and stop the disease progressing. Treatment is unlikely to induce hair regrowth in areas of existing hair loss (Alopecia). Localised treatment includes: Generalised treatment (systemic) options include: Hair transplantation may also be an option if the disease has been in clinical remission for at least 2 years. However, LLP recurrence following transplant has been described. Camouflaging hair loss with careful hair styling or the use of hair pieces, wigs, hair powder, hair color and eyebrow tattooing may also be considered. The likely outcome of LPP is unpredictable. The condition may stabilise or continue to slowly progress over time. Relapse following remission is possible.

        "Lichen planus": "Also known as lichen ruber planus What is lichen planus? Lichen planus is a non-infectious, inflammatory skin condition, which generally occurs in middle-aged adults. It affects up to 1-2% of the population. What causes lichen planus? The cause of lichen planus is unknown but is thought to be due to an abnormal immune reaction (autoimmune disease). It occurs more frequently in those who are infected with hepatitis C; however, most people with lichen planus do not have hepatitis C. Other rarer medical conditions that may be associated with lichen planus include:  viruses such as human herpes virus 6 or 7 (HHV-6 or -7), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV); bacteria such as the helicobacter pilori that can affect the stomach; vaccines and contact allergens such as amalgam teeth fillings; or other metals such as gold or copper. A similar skin condition can be triggered by certain medications such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, non steroidal anti-inflammatories, antimalarials and gold. The time interval from medication exposure to the appearance of the condition can vary from months to more than a year. How is lichen planus diagnosed? Lichen planus may be diagnosed based on its clinical appearance. However, a small sample of skin (skin biopsy) may be necessary in some cases to confirm the diagnosis. What does lichen planus look like? The most common form of the condition presents with 3 to 5 mm diameter, itchy, purple, flat-topped spots (papules) which when looked at closely, have irregular fine white streaks visible on the surface called “Wickham’s striae”. The number of lesions can vary from a few to many. They can join together to form lesions many centimetres in size called “plaques”. The areas typically affected are the fronts of the wrists, ankles and lower back although they can affect any part of the body surface. Skin trauma can promote formation of new lesions. This is called “the Koebner phenomenon”.  When the spots resolve they generally leave brown stains called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation which take months to resolve. There are many forms of lichen planus. They can involve areas beyond the skin as listed below. Oral lesions occur in 50% of those with skin involvement. In some cases, it is the only site of involvement. Oral lesions typically appear as lace-like white streaks on the inside of the cheeks (reticular pattern) but they can also affect the side of the tongue, gums and lips. An erosive form of oral lichen planus results in pain and ulceration which may lead to scarring. Some oral lesions may result from sensitivity to dental restorative materials or toothpaste. Oral lichen planus is a risk factor for oral squamous cell carcinoma, particularly the ulcerative type. In rare cases, it can involve other mucosal sites such as the eyes, nasal mucosa, larynx, oesophagus and anus. Nail changes such as longitudinal grooves, ridges, nail plate thinning, thickening, roughness, nail lifting (onycholysis), nail loss (temporary or permanent) and nail bed scarring (pterygiums) occur in 10% of those with skin lesions. Lesions can involve the glans penis in men and the vulva and vagina in women. Open sores called erosions can develop at these sites sometimes leading to ulceration, pain and scarring. A painful, ulcerative form of lichen planus can affect the inside of the cheek, side of the tongue, gums and inside of the lips, vulva, vagina and penis. Long standing erosive lichen planus can be complicated by squamous cell carcinoma. Lichen planus of the scalp and hair follicles can lead to permanent hair loss. This is a thick, itchy, warty raised form of lichen planus which typically involves the shins. Lichen planus papules form a ring with a central clearing, most commonly on the penis. This form of lichen planus tends to occur in the groin, armpits and under the breasts. This form of lichen planus is surmounted by blisters. Linear lichen planus occurs in straight lines, possibly due to trauma (Koebner phenomenon) or it may occur in isolation. This form of lichen planus is seen more commonly in the Middle East and India. Brown patches typically occur on the face, neck and upper limbs with some cases showing a tendency to affect the armpits. This form of lichen planus mostly occurs in people from India, the Middle East and East Africa. Brown patches with a surrounding white halo occur typically on the face. How is lichen planus treated? Mild cases may require no treatment. Topical corticosteroids are first line therapy. They should be used as directed by your dermatologist as incorrect use can cause side effects. Creams should be applied to the itchy red/purple spots rather than the brown stains. Creams such as pimecrolimus or tacrolimus may be used instead of corticosteroids. Intralesional corticosteroids may be used for thick and stubborn lesions. Short term use of oral corticosteroids over a 6 week period may be used when lichen planus affects many areas of the body or oral lichen planus. Light therapy (phototherapy) can be of benefit for widespread lichen planus. Oral medications such as acitretin, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil are sometimes used in particular cases. What is the likely outcome of lichen planus? Treatment helps control the condition but does not cure it. Most cases are self-resolving over 1 to 2 years regardless of treatment. Even after the condition has cleared, it leaves brown stains which can take many months to resolve. Oral, scalp and nail disease tends to be more persistent. Drug induced lichen planus can take months to resolve after the medication causing the condition has been stopped.

        "Lichen simplex chronicus": "Also known as neurodermatitis What is lichen simplex chronicus? Lichen simplex chronicus is characterised by thickening of the skin due to chronic rubbing or scratching. Exaggerated skin markings termed “lichenification” are common. Lichen simplex chronicus is more common in females. It is also associated with atopic disorders (asthma, eczema, hayfever). What causes it? The cause of lichen simplex chronicus is not well understood but it is initiated by itching. Some people may have no underlying cause or primary skin disease. In others, there is an associated skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis. It can start from a small itchy condition such as an insect bite and continued rubbing and scratching results in lichen simplex chronicus. The condition is thought to be due to an alteration in the nerve fibres resulting in a heightened sensitivity to the itch sensation. This results in a vicious cycle of itching and scratching which becomes difficult to break. In some people, stress or anxiety can play a role in both initiating the process and exacerbating the condition. What does it look like? The affected skin is thickened and leathery, occasionally with surface scaling. Deep scratch marks or scars often accompany the condition. There may be redness due to inflammation and pigmentary changes can be seen, especially in darker skin types. The skin markings are often pronounced in affected areas. There may be broken hairs or a lack of hair within affected areas due to chronic scratching. How is it diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical appearance of the condition. However, skin scrapings may be taken to exclude a fungal infection. Bacterial swabs are taken if secondary infection is suspected (yellow crusting, weeping). A skin biopsy may be needed in atypical cases. How is it treated? Breaking the itch scratch cycle is the key to managing the condition. To reduce itching, an anti-inflammatory such as a strong corticosteroid cream may be used. Physically covering the affected areas with specialised bandaging is helpful in reducing subconscious scratching and helping topical treatments work more effectively. Sedating antihistamines can help reduce sleep disturbance and subconscious scratching in sleep. Other anti-inflammatory treatments include topical calcineurin inhibitors and intralesional steroid injections. Topical menthol or tar preparations can also help reduce itching. In extensive or recalcitrant cases, phototherapy(light treatment) or oral medications such as methotrexate, cyclosporine or oral steroids may be needed. Any underlying skin conditions including dryness of the skin should be addressed. Using moisturisers regularly and avoiding soap is recommended. It is important to keep nails short to minimise further skin trauma. What is the likely outcome of lichen simplex chronicus? The condition can be persistent and is prone to recurrence. Emotional stress can lead to exacerbations. This information has been written by Dr Yin Vun\nUpdated 11 November 2015 Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Linear IgA Disease": "Also known as … Chronic Bullous Dermatosis of Childhood, Linear Immunoglobulin A Dermatosis What is Linear IgA Disease? Linear IgA Disease is a rare skin blistering condition. It affects young children (usually before 5 years of age) or adults (usually after 40 years of age). This condition affects the skin and mucosal (inside the mouth and/or genitalia) surfaces of the body. The exact cause of Linear IgA Disease is unknown however it is considered to be an “autoimmune” disease. The body’s immune system produces antibodies known as Immunoglobulin A (IgA) which are incorrectly deposited in the top layer of the skin in a line – hence the term “linear”. Deposits of antibodies in the skin cause damage to the structure of the skin and a blister appears. Certain medications can cause Linear IgA Disease. The antibiotic, Vancomycin, is the most common known drug to cause Linear IgA Disease. Other drugs reported to cause Linear IgA Disease include: Lithium, Phenytoin, Trimethroprim/ Sulfomethoxazole, Frusemide and Diclofenac. In these cases, the blisters appear after the medication has been started and disappear after the medication has been stopped. Linear IgA Disease was once thought to be related to Dermatitis herpetiformis which occurs in Coeliac disease, but this has been proven to be incorrect. A gluten-free diet will therefore not control or cure Linear IgA Disease. Linear IgA Disease may occur in association with cancer known as ”paraneoplastic phenomenon” or “paraneoplastic syndrome”. Lymphoma and haematological (blood) malignancies are the most common types of cancers seen in association with Linear IgA Disease. Linear IgA Disease may also be associated with inflammatory bowel disease and infection. In Linear IgA Disease multiple tense blisters with a clear fluid appear over parts of the body. The blisters can vary in size and the skin may appear red around the blisters. Blisters often occur in clusters giving a “cluster of jewels” or “string of beads” appearance. Blisters and ulcers may occur on mucosal surfaces such as in the mouth or genitalia. Typically the skin may be itchy or sore or have a burning sensation. Gritty or sore eyes may suggest involvement of the eyes. In rare cases the larynx and/or pharynx (air passages) may be affected which may cause changes in the sound of the voice. Sometimes there may be fever, joint pains and feelings of tiredness. The diagnosis of Linear IgA Disease is usually confirmed with a skin biopsy. Special staining of a skin sample in the laboratory typically shows deposition of the antibody Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the skin. A blood test may show circulating IgA antibodies in the blood. In adults, the condition has an unpredictable course but tends to be chronic (continue for years). Long-term treatment is usually needed to suppress the condition and keep the skin clear of any blisters. Linear IgA Disease often responds extremely well to Dapsone. Other treatments include: Prednisolone, Sulfapyridine, Colchicine, Tetracyclines, Erythromycin, Azathioprine, Cyclosporine or Mycophenolate Mofetil. Topical steroid creams may also be used. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may be used in people who fail to respond to the above-mentioned treatments. In children, the disease tends to disappear over time with most children going into remission within 2 years of onset of the disease. When treated, skin blisters tend to fade away without scarring or leaving a permanent mark on the skin. Serious complications of Linear IgA Disease may include: infection, dehydration and temperature dysregulation. Mucosal lesions inside the mouth or eyes may heal with some scarring. If you notice multiple blisters on your skin you should see a dermatologist immediately.

        "Lipodermatosclerosis": "What is it? Lipodermatosclerosis is a type of panniculitis (inflammation of the fat under the skin) and usually affects the lower legs. It more commonly affects middle-aged people. What causes it? The exact cause of lipodermatosclerosis is not known. Lipodermatosclerosis most commonly occurs in people with raised pressure in the leg veins (venous hypertension or venous incompetence). The raised pressure causes fluid and proteins to leak out of the veins and causes fibrosis and inflammation of the underlying skin. There may also be a lack of oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissue. What does it look like? Lipodermatosclerosis may present as an acute or chronic condition. Acute lipodermatosclerosis presents as painful, red inflammation of the lower legs and is often confused with infection. Chronic lipodermatosclerosis may develop gradually over time or following an acute episode. People with chronic lipodermatosclerosis gradually develop thickened or hardened skin with increased pigmentation. There may be tapering of the legs above the ankles resembling an inverted champagne bottle. Over time the skin may become more fragile resulting in leg ulcers. How is it diagnosed? Lipodermatosclerosis is usually diagnosed based on its clinical appearance. In rare cases, your dermatologist may perform a skin biopsy to exclude other conditions that can look like lipodermatosclerosis. Blood tests are not required. An ultrasound scan of the leg may be performed to look for evidence of problems with the veins. How is it treated? Lipodermatosclerosis may be a difficult condition to treat. Management includes treating the underlying problem with the veins and/or wearing compression stockings. As lipodermatosclerosis is often seen in overweight people, weight reduction is also important. Other treatments that may be of benefit include massage, ultrasound therapy, topical steroid ointments and medications such as pentoxifylline or stanozolol.

        "Lipodystrophy": "Lipodystrophy is a rare group of diseases characterised by the selective loss of fat in certain parts of the body. There are several types of lipodystrophy: congenital generalised lipodystrophy (CGL), familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL), acquired generalised lipodystrophy (AGL), acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL), localised lipodystrophy, and HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy can be either genetic (inherited) or acquired (where one develops the disease later in life). Genetic causes CGL and FPL are caused by genetic abnormalities. In both CGL and FPL, there are multiple genes that are responsible for the disease. CGL is autosomal recessive, which means that both parents need to carry the genetic abnormality for their child to have the disease. FPL is autosomal dominant, which means that only one parent needs to have the abnormal gene for their child to have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. Acquired causes The exact cause behind AGL is unknown. In some cases of AGL, people initially develop painful lumps from inflamed fat, which subsequently leads to generalised fat loss. In other instances, AGL seems to have an autoimmune cause (where one’s immune system attacks the body). The exact cause of APL is unknown. However, APL has a strong association with autoimmune diseases such as lupus and juvenile dermatomyositis. HIV associated lipodystrophy is caused by protease inhibitors which are used in the treatment of HIV. These protease inhibitors interfere with processes in the body that allow fat cells to mature and develop. There are many different causes of localised lipodystrophy. Some of these causes include injections of drugs such as insulin or corticosteroids, pressure, or inflamed subcutaneous fat. Genetic causes People affected by CGL are very muscular from birth, with very little body fat. You may also notice dark patches in the body folds of the skin, a prominent umbilicus, and prominent veins. People with CGL also tend to have coarse and large facial features (acromegaloid). In FPL, the disease starts to show itself around puberty. Fat loss affects the limbs and trunks, and fat tends to accumulate in the face and neck, as well as internally around the organs. Acquired causes AGL tends to occur in childhood or adolescence. Fat loss tends to affect the whole body. APL tends to appear before the age of 15. Fat loss in APL spreads downwards, progressively affecting the face, then the neck, trunk and arms. HIV associated lipodystrophy is characterised by loss of fat from the face, trunk and limbs. Fat is instead deposited on the back between the shoulders, chin, and internally, around the organs. Localised lipodystrophy is characterised by fat loss in small areas, which can leave a dent in the affected area. People with CGL are prone to intellectual impairment, heart muscle weakness, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia (high levels of fat in the bloods). Females with CGL also tend to have problems with fertility. FPL is associated with diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and cardiovascular disease. In AGL, the generalised fat loss can lead to many metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, menstrual abnormalities in women, and fatty liver. 1 in 5 people with APL have an autoimmune kidney problem called membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. However, unlike AGL, metabolic problems are uncommon. HIV associated lipodystrophy is associated with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and cardiovascular disease. Hyperlipidaemia is often associated with acute pancreatitis and can therefore occur in many lipodystrophies. There are no known problems that occur from localised lipodystrophy. Your doctor will need to take a detailed history and perform an examination of your skin to diagnose lipodystrophy. In addition to this, your doctor may require blood tests to look for autoimmune or genetic causes of your lipodystrophy, and to screen you for other medical problems that often accompany lipodystrophy There is no cure for lipodystrophy. The main goals of treatment are to manage the complications of the disease, and to address any cosmetic problems. Cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidaemia People with lipodystrophy need to adhere to a very low-fat diet and to avoid alcohol, particularly if you have fatty liver. It is advisable to have the input of a dietitian. Regular exercise is also highly recommended. Diabetes Your doctor may prescribe diabetic medications such as metformin or insulin if you have high blood sugar levels. It is also important to restrict your sugar intake. Cosmetic surgery Changes in your physical appearance can result in emotional distress. Cosmetic procedures may include fat transfer or fillers to improve the appearance of fat loss in the affected areas. You may also like to consider speaking to a mental health professional if you feel that it would be beneficial. Other considerations For people who have HIV associated lipodystrophy, your doctor may consider switching medications. However, this will not restore the loss of fat in the affected area. The outcome of lipodystrophy depends on what type of lipodystrophy you have. It is important to manage any of the previously mentioned medical problems that occur with lipodystrophy, as they can have severe complications.

        "Livedo reticularis": "What is it? Livedo reticularis is a term referring to the appearance of a “net-like”, red-blue pattern on the skin. There are a number of different types of livedo reticularis: What does it look like? This appears as a mottled discolouration of red and blue resulting in a net-like appearance of the skin. It is usually symmetrical. It often affects the lower limbs, but the trunk and upper limbs may also be affected. What causes it? Generally, livedo reticularis arises from altered blood flow in the skin microcirculation (the small blood vessels that supply the skin). A variety of factors reduces the flow of fresh arterial blood to the skin. This leads to the collection of venous blood and gives rise to the typical purplish colour. Cold weather can induce the arteriolar walls to spasm. However, in physiologic livedo reticularis, the pattern tends to disappear when the affected area is warmed. Other causes include reduced blood flow due to hyperviscosity (thickened consistency of the blood), vessel wall pathology (e.g. from blood vessel inflammation) or obstruction (e.g. from a blood clot inside the vessel). What other problems can occur with this condition? How is it diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist, based on the appearance of the condition. Blood tests are performed to diagnose possible underlying causes. A skin biopsy may also provide a clue to the underlying related condition. Primary livedo reticularis is a “diagnosis of exclusion” which means that the term is only used if no other cause can be detected. How is it treated? Usually no treatment is required in physiologic livedo reticularis and it is enough for affected individuals to avoid the cold. Where the cosmetic concern is great, the area can be camouflaged. With secondary livedo reticularis, it is important to identify and treat the underlying condition. What is the likely outcome of it? The chance of making a good recovery from primary livedo reticularis is excellent. In secondary livedo reticularis, the likely outcome relates to the underlying disorder.

        "Pyogenic Granuloma": "Also known as Lobular capillary haemangioma What is a pyogenic granuloma? A pyogenic granuloma is a common benign (not malignant) growth of blood vessels on the skin. It appears as a single fast growing red nodule that commonly bleeds. Whilst benign, pyogenic granulomas can be distressing due to their appearance and fast growth. What causes a pyogenic granuloma? The exact cause of a pyogenic granuloma is not known however minor trauma is thought to play a role in their development. Hormones are also thought to play a role, as pregnant women are more likely to develop a pyogenic granuloma inside their mouth. Pyogenic granulomas can occur in anyone but are more common in young children and in females. They can occur anywhere on the body but are more common on the head and neck, upper trunk and hands, especially on the fingers. What does a pyogenic granuloma look like? Pyogenic granulomas usually appear and grow very quickly (usually over days to weeks). Pyogenic granulomas are usually bright red and have a shiny surface. They grow out of the skin and can have a stalk. They tend to bleed very easily, even with a minor bump, and can form a crust over the top. They can become darker red in colour with time. They may be lumpy on the surface like a raspberry. Pyogenic granulomas are not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person. They do not turn into cancers and are not usually painful. How is a pyogenic granuloma diagnosed? A dermatologist can make the diagnosis based on the appearance of the lesion and the history of rapid growth. A biopsy may be performed in order to confirm the diagnosis. How is pyogenic granuloma treated? In general, a pyogenic granuloma will not disappear without treatment.  However, cases of pyogenic granuloma developing during pregnancy have been known to resolve without treatment once the pregnancy is over. Whilst benign and painless, pyogenic granulomas tend to be a nuisance because they bleed easily and can be unsightly. The most common treatment is “curettage and cautery” which involves surgically scraping off the pyogenic granuloma and sealing the bleeding. Pyogenic granulomas have a high risk of recurring and occasionally need to be surgically excised (cut out with stitches) which gives the best possible chance of them not growing back. Any fast growing lesion on the skin that bleeds should be seen by a specialist dermatologist to ensure it is not skin cancer.

        "What is morphoea?": "Morphoea is a disorder of the skin collagen. Morphoea is characterised by thickening of the skin. It does not usually have any internal involvement. ",
        "Who gets morphoea?": "It can occur at any age but most commonly occurs in young adults and children. Females are more likely than males to develop morphea (ratio 4:1). 1 Caucasians are more commonly affected by morphea, followed by individuals who are Hispanic and Latin American. ",
        "What causes morphoea?": "The cause of morphoea is not known. However, autoimmune and environmental may be contributing factors. Some individuals may develop morphoea after an infection such as measles, varicella and Borrelia burgdorferi. Cases of morphea have been reported after vaccinations. 2 ",
        "What does morphoea look like?": "The excessive accumulation of collagen in the skin makes the affected areas look and feel thickened and hard. The skin over the area becomes attached and unable to be pinched. At first, morphoea presents as a pale, ivory-coloured spot with a surrounding red or purple border. Single or multiple oval hard lesions (plaques) appear more commonly on the trunk and extremities. Less commonly, the affected areas can be widespread (generalised) or affect deeper structures (such as fat, fascia, muscle or bone). Linear morphoea, a particular form of the condition, presents as a very thick band that produces contractures in fingers, arms or joints or affects important structures such as the particular presentation of “en coup de sabre” which gets its name from its similarity to a sabre wound to the face, forehead and scalp. ",
        "How is morphoea diagnosed?": "The condition is usually diagnosed clinically. A tissue sample from the affected area is often taken to confirm the diagnosis. There are no specific blood tests available that can help to confirm the diagnosis, but they can be used to rule out an underlying medical condition. ",
        "How is morphoea treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to reduce inflammation and avoid deposits of collagen. Some commonly used treatments may include topical or systemic steroids, topical vitamin D analogues, oral methotrexate, intralesional therapy, phototherapy or some potent systemic immunosuppressants such as cyclosphosphamine. Severe or complicated cases may require a combination of therapy and referral to other specialties (such as surgery and physiotherapy). ",
        "What is the likely outcome of morphoea?": "Most cases of morphoea heal spontaneously, leaving a scar. However, it can follow a protracted course, which can be relapsing and remitting or chronically active. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Lymphomatoid papulosis": "What is lymphomatoid papulosis? Lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare chronic skin condition which can occur at any age or in any race (prevalence rate 1 to 2 cases per 1,000,000). It has a gradual onset and typically has no symptoms but can cause itch in the skin of some people. Individuals are otherwise well. The condition is not contagious and it is not inherited. It is characterised by the proliferation of T cell lymphocytes in the skin that cause multiple, recurrent lumps. What causes lymphomatoid papulosis? The cause of lymphomatoid papulosis is unknown. It is characterised by collections of immune blood cells called lymphocytes or T cells in the skin. Even experts have difficulty fully classifying the condition. Some consider it a benign disorder of the immune system, others a low grade skin lymphoma with the ability to resolve spontaneously. It is generally accepted as a benign disease of the skin only. What does lymphomatoid papulosis look like? Most commonly, lymphomatoid papulosis causes a rash characterised by crops of small, crusted or scabbed lesions on the skin. The appearance and number of these lesions can be highly variable. They can be skin-coloured or red bumps called papules or larger lumps called nodules. These lesions can occur anywhere but are typically scattered over the body with normal skin in between. They tend to group around the groin or trunk in a bathing suit distribution. The lesions commonly show rapid growth and may then ulcerate (i.e. the surface may break) before healing spontaneously after 2 to 8 weeks. When the lesions heal, they generally leave a small depressed scar. However, some lesions heal without scarring. Waves of new lesions occur spontaneously and wax and wane over time. The lesions themselves are often symptomless but some individuals report itchiness or pain. How is lymphomatoid papulosis diagnosed? A skin biopsy is critical in the diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis. The sample is processed and the cells examined under a microscope. Lymphomatoid papulosis microscopically displays T cells that carry a marker called CD30. Further tests are not necessary unless there are other symptoms or abnormalities. What other problems can occur with lymphomatoid papulosis? Lymphomatoid papulosis may be associated with other blood cell lymphomas or cancers of the blood such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma, mycosis fungoides and other cutaneous lymphomas. These other lymphomas may occur before, during or after the diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis. For this reason, it is very important that affected individuals are reviewed regularly by a dermatologist. Should a blood cell lymphoma occur, the affected person will be referred to a haematologist who is a doctor specialising in blood disorders. However, the incidence of associated blood lymphomas is low How is lymphomatoid papulosis treated? There is no cure for the condition and no standard treatment. Treatment is tailored to an individual’s symptoms and to addressing the skin issues to prevent scarring. If there are few skin lesions which are not itchy or tender, it is may be reasonable not to provide specific treatment and simply observe the skin over time. For those who want or require treatment, first line options include phototherapy, topical corticosteroids and antibiotics called tetracyclines. Tetracyclines are typically used if ulcerated lesions become infected. A medication called methotrexate is usually used for people with more extensive disease. It is important to have ongoing skin checks to assess for the possible development of associated lymphomas, regardless of whether or not the condition is being actively treated. What is the likely outcome of lymphomatoid papulosis? In nearly all cases, lymphomatoid has an excellent prognosis and the condition remains benign or non-cancerous. All lesions will heal by themselves with time. However, the condition typically recurs with cyclic eruptions. There have also been cases of the condition clearing completely. Treatment does not alter whether or not an associated lymphoma will develop. This means affected individuals should have a skin check by their doctor every 6 to 12 months for as long as the rash continues. Contact your doctor if you experience any fever, weight loss, night sweating or if any existing lesions do not heal within 2 to 3 months.

        "Who gets androgenetic alopecia (in men)?": "Androgenetic alopecia (in men) can affect men of any age group after puberty. Approximately 50% of men show signs of cosmetically apparent baldness by the age of 50.1 ",
        "What causes androgenetic alopecia (in men)?": "Most affected men have a genetic predisposition to the condition that could be inherited from either or both parents. Genes such as the androgen receptor gene have been reported to be linked to the condition.2 At the scalp level, hair follicles tend to react and shrink with time under the influence of normal levels of male hormone. This does not imply any underlying hormonal abnormalities. However, men who take anabolic steroid supplements may find that this accelerates the progression of their baldness. ",
        "What does androgenetic alopecia (in men) look like?": "The pattern of baldness is easily recognisable. It usually begins with recession of the hairline at the temples and front of the scalp. This slowly advances further backwards. The hairs on the top of the scalp also become sparser. With time, the areas of baldness join. The whole scalp may be completely bald except for the back of the scalp (occipital scalp) which is usually protected from the balding process. In Asian men, the pattern is sometimes less pronounced and hair loss can present in a more diffuse pattern. ",
        "How is androgenetic alopecia (in men) diagnosed?": "This is an easily recognisable condition that can be diagnosed clinically. ",
        "How is androgenetic alopecia (in men) treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to slow or stop the progression of hair loss and then try to stimulate some hair regrowth. Treatment may include: Hair regeneration therapies, such as platelet-rich plasma injections and autologous scalp tissue micrografting are being increasingly used. However, the efficacy of these treatments varies between individuals with androgenetic alopecia (in men). Hair tonics and nutritional supplements are of very limited benefit. Caps and hats also provide sun protection to the scalp, as well as camouflaging hair loss. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of androgenetic alopecia (in men)?": "Androgenetic alopecia (in men) is mainly a cosmetic condition. It can cause significant psychological and social stress for some affected men. This form of hair loss is a normal process of ageing in genetically predisposed men. Without treatment, the condition is likely to progress gradually. Most men come to terms with the condition with time, without the need for treatment. Hair on the scalp provides protection against ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure. Men with androgenetic alopecia (in men) may be more likely to develop skin cancer or solar keratoses on their scalp without sun protection. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "What is mastocytosis?": "Mastocytosis is a condition where mast cells accumulate in the skin or sometimes in internal organs. Mast cells are normal cells in the body, usually found in the skin and other tissues. Mast cells are part of our immune system and have a role in the body’s ability to fight certain infections (mainly parasites) and the body’s coordination of healing responses to an injury and reaction to an allergy. Mast cells contain many different chemicals, such as histamine, that increase inflammation. In the skin this results in localised itching, swelling, redness and sometimes blistering (similar to what happens normally in insect bites). What causes mastocytosis? Most forms of mastocytosis are caused by a change in a single area of a gene (c-kit) that causes overproduction of mast cells. In most cases there is no family history of mastocytosis and it is rarely, if ever, passed on to the next generation. What does mastocytosis look like? Mastocytosis most commonly affects only the skin where it is referred to as “cutaneous mastocytosis”. The condition can also involve internal organs where it is referred to as “systemic mastocytosis”. There are some cases of systemic mastocytosis which do not have skin involvement. Cutaneous mastocytosis Cutaneous mastocytosis causes itching, swelling and blistering of the affected skin, particularly when it is rubbed or scratched. There are two main types of skin mastocytosis: This is a single reddish or yellowish-brown thickened patch of skin. It usually occurs in infants and resolves on its own over the first decade of life. This is a rash with light brown, itchy, raised patches on any part of the body. This form can affect either children or adults. When children are affected, it tends to occur while they are quite young and usually resolves around puberty. When it starts in older children or in adults, it tends to be more persistent and can be associated in some cases with internal involvement and/or systemic symptoms. Internal involvement is very rare in young children. There are less common forms of skin mastocytosis: This usually occurs in the first year of life. It presents with widespread red and itchy skin that may blister. This is an adult type of mastocytosis. It is very persistent and may sometimes lead to systemic involvement. Systemic mastocytosis Systemic mastocytosis refers to an increase in mast cells in internal organs. The majority of cases will have non-skin (systemic) symptoms. There may or may not be skin involvement as well. A wide range of symptoms can occur depending on where the mast cells are. The vast majority of people with systemic mastocytosis have a form called indolent systemic mastocytosis. The severity of symptoms depends on the number of mast cells in the tissues. A high load of mast cells tends to lead to more severe symptoms. Non skin symptoms can include flushing, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, racing of the heart, bone aches, anxiety, shortness of breath, wheezing and fainting. How is mastocytosis diagnosed? Cutaneous mastocytosis is usually diagnosed by its appearance and the fact that rubbing the affected area causes redness or even blistering (known as Darier’s sign). A skin biopsy may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. A blood test showing levels of tryptase 5 to10 times the upper limit of normal may suggest systemic involvement. Some people may need extra tests to check for systemic involvement such as blood tests, scans and, in some cases, a bone marrow biopsy. How is mastocytosis treated? Most localised forms of cutaneous mastocytosis (solitary mastocytoma) without symptoms require no treatment. The vast majority of people with cutaneous mastocytosis, including those with systemic mastocytosis, have a normal life expectancy and treatment is directed at symptom control. General measures If there is systemic involvement, certain triggers may cause symptoms to occur. Not all triggers occur in all people with systemic symptoms. Triggers should be avoided. Possible triggers for mastocytosis symptoms include: Specific treatments The treatment needed depends on an individual’s symptoms and test results. It may include the following: Severe cases of systemic mastocytosis or aggressive forms of mastocytosis may be treated with systemic medications, including types of chemotherapy or immune therapy.

        "Medication-induced cutaneous pigmentation": "What is medication induced cutaneous pigmentation? Medication-induced cutaneous (skin) pigmentation (MIP) is due to various topical, oral and intravenous medications. Common agents include minocycline, amiodarone, antimalarials, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, bleomycin and cytotoxic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and heavy metals (e.g. silver, gold and mercury). Medications can also cause loss of pigmentation or hypopigmentation. What causes MIP? MIP may be due to the accumulation of heavy metals or drug-pigment complexes within the skin, direct stimulation of the pigment cells (melanophages) to produce melanin or by causing inflammation. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure may play a role in some cases. What does MIP look like? The appearance of MIP depends on which drug has caused the pigmentation. What other problems can occur with MIP? There are no associated problems with MIP in the majority of cases. However, there are reports of minocycline-induced pigmentation deposits in nails, bone, teeth and other internal organs, particularly in children. Pigmentation of the nails can result from minocycline, antimalarial and cytotoxic drugs. Pigmentation of the eyes can result from antimalarial and antipsychotic medications. Antimalarials can cause cornea and retina lesions. Antipsychotics can cause cataracts and corneal lesions. How is MIP diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made clinically. A skin biopsy may be needed in some cases to differentiate the condition from other pigmentary disorders. How is MIP treated? Withdrawal of the causative agent is the first step. The pigmentation often fades by itself but may take time. Sun protection is essential in cases of UV-induced pigment change. Topical depigmenting agents are not usually effective in clearing the pigmentation. Laser and light based treatments are often recommended but results are inconsistent. Most affected people ask for treatment to speed up the resolution of the pigmentation. Quality-switched (QS) lasers have been most commonly used and have been widely reported to date. QS Nd Yag (1064nm), QS Alexandrite (755nm) and QS Ruby 694nm have been used with some success in lightening pigmentation. Several treatments are required over many months to see improvements. More recently, one case series reported in Australia showed clearing or significant lightening of minocycline-induced pigmentation with just a few treatments with picosecond laser treatment. Further evaluation of this modality is needed. Pigmentation caused by anticonvulsants usually resolves within a few months of ceasing the medication.

        "What are moles?": "Moles are normal overgrowths of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Almost everyone has moles. They are not normally present at birth but appear in childhood and early teenage years. ",
        "Who get moles?": "Australians with fair skin often have larger numbers of moles compared to those with the same skin complexion in other countries. This may be due to the high sun exposure Australians experience during childhood. By the age of 15, Australian children have an average of more than 50 moles. ",
        "What cause moles?": "The number of moles that develop in an individual is predominately determined by genetic (inherited) factors and to a lesser extent by sunlight exposure. Childhood and early teenage years are the times when sunlight influences the development of new moles most strongly. ",
        "What do moles look like?": "Moles are generally medium to dark brown in colour, but can range from skin coloured or pink to black in colour. Most moles are flat, relatively even in colour and regular in shape. Some moles are raised, and these are usually soft to touch and lighter in colour. Moles need to be distinguished from freckles that occur on the faces of red-headed and fair-skinned children or on the shoulders following sunburns. Moles can appear anywhere on the body including palms and soles, nails, genitals, scalp and eyes. ",
        "How are moles diagnosed?": "Moles are usually diagnosed clinically based on their appearance. There are some changes individuals can look out for when observing moles, including: ",
        "How are moles treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Most moles are harmless and do not require treatment. They may be removed to exclude cancer, if the mole is irritating the individual (i.e., by clothing, combing or shaving), or for cosmetic reasons. Surgical techniques used to remove moles may include excision biopsy, shave biopsy, electrosurgical destruction and laser. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of moles?": "Moles have a very small risk of developing into melanoma. However, the more moles an individual has, the greater risk of melanoma. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "What is melanoma?": "Melanoma is a cancer that arises in pigment cells of the skin (melanocytes). If not detected early, it has the capacity to spread through blood vessels and lymph channels to other parts of the body. Australia has some of the highest rates of melanoma in the world, with more than 18,000 cases diagnosed each year. 1 ",
        "Who gets melanoma?": "Melanomas are more common in individuals with fair skin. Individuals with large numbers of moles or large, unevenly coloured, irregularly shaped (dysplastic) moles are more likely to develop a melanoma. Light hair (especially red hair) and light eye colour are associated with a greater risk of developing melanoma. Other risk factors include freckles (a marker of fair skin) and solar lentigines (sunburn freckles). Individuals with a family history of melanoma have a 74% increased risk in developing melanoma. 2 Individuals who have had a previous skin cancer diagnosis are at increased risk of developing melanoma. Individuals who have also had at least one melanoma are at high risk of developing a new melanoma. ",
        "What causes melanoma?": "Almost all melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or solariums. Most melanomas in younger Australians (under 50 years) are due to occasional sun exposure of the kind that produces sunburn. Childhood sun exposure is a particularly important contributor to these melanomas. Melanomas in older Australians (over 50 years) are more strongly related to regular sun exposure over a long period. ",
        "What does melanoma look like?": "More than half of melanomas begin as a new spot and the remainder, arise from a pre-existing mole. 3 They begin as a flat, light brown to black spot that looks like a mole. However, melanomas, unlike moles, will grow progressively larger at a rate that will often be detected over a few months. As they enlarge, changes in shape and colour also progress so that the spot becomes increasingly irregular in shape or variable in colour. An important exception is the melanomas that have little or no pigment and appear predominantly red in colour. Another exception is nodular melanoma, which has no flat phase and presents as raised from the outset and are also most often red in colour. These may bleed repeatedly especially if they are knocked or bumped. Melanomas that are detected while they are still flat are almost always cured by removal. All melanomas will eventually become raised, increase in-depth and become more life threatening. Figure 1. Initially flat melanoma (superficial spreading type) – Image reproduced with permission of Prof John Kelly Figure 2.

These usually have little pigment – Image reproduced with permission of Prof John Kelly ",
        "How is melanoma diagnosed?": "If an individual has a suspicious spot, they should consult their GP. Following initial examination, they may then be referred to a dermatologist for further assessment. If possible, suspicious spots are removed completely and the entire spot sent to pathology for assessment. Partial biopsies are sometimes necessary. ",
        "How is melanoma treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. All melanomas are treated surgically by removing both the melanoma along with a safety margin of normal appearing skin around it. The width of the safety margin removed varies according to the depth of the melanoma. If the melanoma is more than 0.8 mm in depth, there may be the option of a sentinel node biopsy (SNB). A SNB may provide information about an individual’s risk for spread of melanoma beyond the skin. For individuals with both a higher risk of primary melanoma and a positive SNB, the addition of targeted or immunotherapy will offer a reduced chance of recurrence. Treatment with drugs targeting specific melanoma mutations (targeted therapy) or immunotherapy may reduce recurrence after initial melanoma spread has been treated. These drugs are also used to treat advanced spread that cannot be surgically removed. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of melanoma?": "Melanomas that are diagnosed early often have a  good prognosis (very low risk of spreading to other body parts or becoming life threatening). Once it begins to grow in depth, the prognosis of melanoma differs, depending on several factors. The depth of the melanoma (thickness), ulceration (surface breakdown and crusting) and the stage of melanoma (how advanced and how far spread it already is) can influence an individual’s risk of the spread from melanoma.

        "Who gets melasma?": "Melasma is more commonly seen in females. It usually gets worse in summer months. ",
        "What causes melasma?": "The cause of melasma is unknown but many different factors may play a role. These include genetics, sun exposure and hormonal changes (e.g. using the oral contraceptive pill, pregnancy). Ultraviolet radiation stimulates melanocytes (pigment producing cells) to produce more melanin (dark pigment). Evidence suggests that blood vessel abnormalities within the patches of melasma can also contribute to excessive pigmentation. 1 ",
        "What does melasma look like?": "Melasma appears as patchy areas of light brown, tan or even dark brown pigmentation. The excessive melanin may be located in the superficial layers of the skin (epidermal melasma), the deeper layers of the skin (deep melasma) or in both layers of the skin (mixed melasma). The areas of skin most commonly affected are the forehead, cheeks and upper lip. In rare cases, melasma can affect the forearms. Figure 1. Melasma under the eye – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Davin Lim. Figure 2. Melasma on upper lip – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Davin Lim. Figure 3. Melasma on forehead – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Davin Lim. ",
        "How is melasma diagnosed?": "Melasma is usually diagnosed after examining the colour and distribution of the pigment on the face. A handheld dermatoscope (polarized magnifying instrument) may be used to assist diagnosis. A small sample of the skin (biopsy) may be taken to further confirm the diagnosis and exclude other causes of increased pigmentation. ",
        "How is melasma treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. General measures, such as sun protection is essential with a SPF50 or SPF50+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant and ideally iron oxide containing sunscreen. Sunscreens should be applied twice a day, 20 minutes prior to sun exposure. Broad brimmed hats should be worn when outdoors. If hormonal factors are implicated, the use of the oral contraceptive pill or intrauterine devices should be discontinued if feasible. Treatment options may include: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of melasma?": "Epidermal melasma has a better prognosis than mixed or dermal melasma but all types are recurrent and require ongoing treatment. Often melasma will achieve improvement but not complete clearance. Melasma associated with pregnancy is likely to improve, with pigment gradually fading over months.

The exact cause is unknown. However, factors including allergy to foods and medication, contact allergy, genetic predisposition and infection have been implicated. The first symptom of the condition is often an intermittent and usually painless swelling. As it progresses, the episodes become more frequent and may involve both lips. There may be painful cracks, fissures, reddish brown discoloration and scaling. In rare cases, granulomatous cheilitis has been reported with facial nerve palsy and fissured tongue resulting in a condition known as Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome.

        "Miliaria": "Also known as heat rash, prickly heat or sweat rash What is miliaria? Miliaria is a group of skin conditions that arise from blockage of sweat ducts. There are three types of miliaria classified by the level of blockage of the sweat duct. These include miliaria crystalline, miliaria rubra and miliaria profunda. Who develops miliaria? Miliaria appears in about 15% of newborns. Babies are more commonly affected than children or adults as their sweat ducts are not yet fully developed. Adults may also be affected, particularly those who work in humid and hot conditions. What causes miliaria? Miliaria is caused by obstruction of sweat ducts, often from heat and excess sweating. Common situations in which blockage of the sweat ducts occurs include: No known diseases are associated with miliaria. What does miliaria look like? Miliaria commonly appears in areas of skin that have been blocked particularly around the neck and upper trunk in both children and adults. Other areas that can be affected include the groin, waistline, under the breasts, skin folds and armpits. Unlike acne, miliaria does not arise around hair follicles. Miliaria crystallina appears as small, superficial and clear blisters. These break easily from mild friction or bathing. Miliaria rubra appears as small, red flat or bumpy spots that are usually itchy. In chronic and recurrent cases, the lesions can turn into pus-filled spots. Miliaria profunda appears as deep red or white lumps that are prickly. These lesions are generally not itchy as they appear below the itch receptors. How is miliaria diagnosed? Miliaria is most often diagnosed based on the typical appearance of the lesions. The doctor may perform a simple diagnostic test where a fine needle is used to rupture the blister so that the clear fluid/sweat can be assessed. A biopsy of the skin may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish it from other conditions that look similar (e.g. erythema toxicum neonatorum, neonatal cephalic pustulosis, candidiasis, Grover’s disease). The doctor may also request a skin swab to rule out secondary infection. Individuals who develop heat stress syndrome may need to have blood tests. What other problems can occur with miliaria? Miliaria spots can become infected and form abscesses (pus-filled lumps). In addition, when a large surface area of the body is affected, affected individuals can develop a high temperature and suffer from heat stress syndrome. How is miliaria treated? Miliaria usually disappears after the body is cooled down. It is best prevented by avoiding overheating and over swaddling. More severe cases (e.g. miliaria profunda) can take several weeks to resolve as time is required for the plugs that block the opening of sweat ducts to be pushed outward by new sweat duct cells. General measures recommended to improve symptoms: Soothing lotions (e.g. calamine lotion) or topical steroids may help to relieve symptoms. Antiseptics and antibiotics may be recommended if a secondary infection is suspected. What is the likely outcome of miliaria? Miliaria usually disappears without any significant complications once the affected person is placed in a cool and ventilated environment. In rare cases where a person suffers from chronic and recurrent miliaria rubra or profunda, a large number of sweat glands may end up not functioning properly. This can lead to compensatory facial sweating. Individuals who develop secondary infection or heat stress syndrome need appropriate follow-up by the doctor.

        "Mohs surgery": "Also known as Mohs or Mohs’ surgery What is Mohs surgery? Mohs surgery is an advanced technique that ensures complete removal of skin cancers with minimal loss of surrounding tissue. It was originally developed in the USA by Dr Frederick Mohs in the early 1940s. It involves removal and comprehensive analysis and mapping of excised tumour tissue under the microscope, in order to determine the exact nature and extent of the tumour. Mohs surgery delivers the highest cure rate of all methods of skin cancer removal (over 95%). In Australia, Mohs surgery is performed by an accredited Mohs specialist. To become a Mohs specialist, an FACD qualified specialist dermatologist must undertake an additional one to two years of intensive specialist training and meet specific requirements. A list of accredited Mohs surgeons can be found at the Australasian College of Dermatologists website. Mohs surgeons must engage in ongoing quality assurance activities to maintain their accreditation. In addition to the Mohs specialist, a specialised team is involved in patient care, including doctors, nurses and laboratory staff. What are the benefits of Mohs surgery? When is Mohs surgery performed? What does Mohs surgery involve? Mohs is routinely performed under local anaesthetic. It is a multi-stage procedure with each “Mohs stage” taking approximately 1 hour (although this is an estimate and the time can vary). A Mohs stage involves removal and comprehensive analysis of suspect tissue. How is Mohs surgery different from routine skin surgery? What are the risks of Mohs surgery?

        "Molluscum Contagiosum": "What is molluscum contagiosum? Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral skin infection which occurs worldwide but is more common in warm climates. This condition frequently affects children. In healthy individuals molluscum contagiosum is a harmless infection which resolves spontaneously without treatment.  Infection is spread by direct skin contact with infected individuals.  Outbreaks may occur among children who bathe or swim together and sexual transmission is possible. Incubation periods range from 2 weeks to 6 months. What do molluscum contagiosum look like? Molluscum contagiosum lesions are small round dome-shaped lumps which are generally 3 to 6 mm in diameter, however they can be as large as 30 mm in diameter. The lumps often have a central dip and are pearly or skin coloured. Dermatitis and itch can occur around the lumps, particularly in children with atopic eczema. Scratching can spread the infection and crops of lesions appear as the virus spreads. How is molluscum contagiosum diagnosed? Molluscum contagiosum is usually diagnosed as a result of a physical examination by your doctor. Formal tests are not usually required to reach a diagnosis. How is molluscum contagiosum treated? Treatment of molluscum contagiosum is not essential as most lesions will resolve (go away) spontaneously. However, it can take a long time for the condition to resolve. Treatment is usually aimed at limiting the spread of the condition and alleviating symptoms such as itching. Any associated dermatitis may be treated with corticosteroid creams. Showering rather than taking a bath may limit the spread of infection. Treatment, if given, often needs to be repeated until the lesions clear. Treatments may include: Most cases of molluscum contagiosum spontaneously improve after 6 to 9 months. However lesions can persist for much longer in children with impaired immune systems.

        "Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis": "Also known as … Atopic Winter Feet, Forefoot Dermatitis, Moon-boot Foot Syndrome, Sweaty Sock Dermatitis What is Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis? Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis is a skin condition where there is cracking and peeling of the weight-bearing areas of the soles. The condition occurs primarily (but not exclusively) in children who have atopic dermatitis (eczema), asthma or hay fever. Their skin seems more sensitive than the skin of others and friction appears to play a role. Boys aged 3 to 14are most commonly affected. This condition tends to be better in winter when shoes and socks are being worn, deteriorating in summer due to increased friction with the foot moving more in sandals, particularly if sweaty. Wearing socks and shoes made of synthetic material can exacerbate the condition. The soles become shiny and glazed with some scaling, painful cracks and fissures. Sometimes the heel and palms are affected as well. The tops of the feet, the web spaces between the toes and the instep are typically spared. A diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on a medical history and the appearance of the rash. However, investigations such as skin scrapings or patch tests may be needed to distinguish it from other skin conditions (such as psoriasis, keratolysis exfoliativa, contact allergic dermatitis or fungal infection). Prognosis is good as the condition usually resolves by puberty.

        "What does morphoea look like?": "The excessive accumulation of collagen in the skin makes the affected areas look and feel thickened and hard.

Single or multiple oval hard lesions (plaques) appear more commonly on the trunk and extremities. Less commonly, the affected areas can be widespread (generalised) or affect deeper structures (such as fat, fascia, muscle or bone). Linear morphoea, a particular form of the condition, presents as a very thick band that produces contractures in fingers, arms or joints or affects important structures such as the particular presentation of “en coup de sabre” which gets its name from its similarity to a sabre wound to the face, forehead and scalp. ",
        "How is morphoea diagnosed?": "The condition is usually diagnosed clinically. A tissue sample from the affected area is often taken to confirm the diagnosis. There are no specific blood tests available that can help to confirm the diagnosis, but they can be used to rule out an underlying medical condition. ",
        "How is morphoea treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to reduce inflammation and avoid deposits of collagen. Some commonly used treatments may include topical or systemic steroids, topical vitamin D analogues, oral methotrexate, intralesional therapy, phototherapy or some potent systemic immunosuppressants such as cyclosphosphamine. Severe or complicated cases may require a combination of therapy and referral to other specialties (such as surgery and physiotherapy). ",
        "What is the likely outcome of morphoea?": "Most cases of morphoea heal spontaneously, leaving a scar. However, it can follow a protracted course, which can be relapsing and remitting or chronically active. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Mucoceles": "Also known as: Mucocele of the Lip or Mucous Cyst Mucoceles are small cysts inside the mouth, which commonly occur in the inner surface of the lower lip but can also occur in other areas of the mouth. Mucoceles occur due to interruptions in small salivary glands ducts due to trauma. This can lead to a build-up of mucous material in the surrounding connective tissue layers.  It is often associated with surrounding inflammation and scar tissue. Together these form a mucocele. Mucoceles look like bluish or white round-shaped, firm lesions within the mouth. If you shine a light on them, you can often see through them. Mucoceles most commonly occur on the inner surface of the lip.  They can also occur on the bottom floor of the mouth, the inner cheek, over the gums and tongue. Mucoceles are usually painless lesions, but they can become bothersome to individuals. A doctor usually diagnoses mucoceles through history and examination.  A skin sample (biopsy) may be recommended to rule out any other similar diseases. Mucoceles are benign and do not require specific treatment. If mucoceles reoccur and become bothersome your doctor may consider: Mucoceles can remain present for many days to weeks before they spontaneously rupture and resolve on their own. However, recurrence is common. This information has been written by Dr Subashini Gnanendran and Dr Rachael Anforth Published October 2020 Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Kawasaki’s disease": "Previously known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome What is Kawasaki’s disease? Kawasaki’s disease is a rare form of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels). It can affect many parts of the body. The diagnosis is made when someone has a high fever and the typical changes in the skin, eyes, mouth and lymph nodes. It is a serious condition as it may affect the heart. What causes Kawasaki’s disease? The cause of Kawasaki’s disease is unknown. One theory is that it may be triggered by an infection. However, this has not been proven and antibiotics are not needed. The condition is not contagious. Asian people, particularly Japanese boys, are more likely to be affected which suggests a genetic predisposition to the condition. What does Kawasaki’s disease look like? Kawasaki’s disease is more common in children. Most cases occur in children under 2 years of age. All those affected with Kawasaki’s disease have a fever (up to 40°C) that continues for at least 5 days. Other features include: At least four of these features (known as the diagnostic criteria) are needed to diagnose Kawasaki’s disease. People with fever and less than four features may be diagnosed with “incomplete Kawasaki’s disease”. It can be difficult to make the diagnosis as features may develop at different times. There are also similar changes caused by many infections, as well as reactions to medications and some forms of arthritis. What other problems can occur with Kawasaki’s disease? Other areas of the body can be affected, causing sore joints, headaches, diarrhoea and vomiting. The most serious complication is heart disease, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), aneurysms (dilation of blood vessels) and damage to the heart valves. How is Kawasaki’s disease diagnosed? There is no test to diagnose Kawasaki’s disease. It is diagnosed based on the appearance of the condition and whether this meets the diagnostic criteria listed above. Investigations may be needed to exclude other infections. When Kawasaki’s disease is considered, it is very important to check which areas of the body are involved. Blood tests, an ECG (heart tracing) and echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) may be needed. How is Kawasaki’s disease treated? People with Kawasaki’s disease are usually treated in hospital. The goals of treatment are to manage fever and pain and to reduce inflammation and potentially long term damage to the blood vessels. Immunoglobulin is given into the veins. A high dose of aspirin is given, usually continuing for two months. Long-term follow up by a cardiologist is recommended. What is the likely outcome of Kawasaki’s disease? Affected people usually recover from the condition in 1 to 2 months. Without treatment, 20% of cases have heart damage and some may die. With appropriate treatment, the risk of permanent heart damage is less than 5%.

        "Who get digital myxoid cysts?": "Digital myxoid cysts are usually diagnosed in people over the age of 50 and are associated with osteoarthritis and osteophytes (bone spurs). 1 ",
        "What cause digital myxoid cysts?": "The exact cause is not known. The cyst is frequently connected to the lining of the finger or toenail joint and is usually located between the joint and the nail. Arthritis of the joint at the end of the finger or toe probably predisposes an individual to developing these cysts. ",
        "What do digital myxoid cysts look like?": "Digital myxoid cysts are skin-coloured, reddish or slightly translucent. If a cyst overlies the area where the nail is formed, it may cause a groove to occur along the length of the nail. Sometimes, slightly sticky, clear, straw-coloured or blood-stained contents may leak out of the cyst. Most individuals usually develop only one cyst. However, some individuals may develop more than one cyst on different fingers. The cyst is usually not painful. However, a cyst may become tender, especially when knocked. Occasionally, there may also be symptoms of arthritis with pain, stiffness and deformity of the joint. Cysts may get in the way and their appearance may cause concern. Digital myxoid cysts rarely become infected. ",
        "How are digital myxoid cysts diagnosed?": "A digital myxoid cyst is usually easily recognised as a small lump overlying the end joint of a finger or toe. There may or may not be a groove present in the adjacent fingernail. If the skin over the top of the cyst is broken, a discharge of clear, slightly sticky material from the cyst is characteristic. If the cyst arises under the nail the diagnosis is more difficult. The overlying nail is often deformed. A scan or a biopsy (sample taken from the cyst with a local anaesthetic) may be needed to confirm diagnosis. ",
        "How are digital myxoid cysts treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. If a digital myxoid cyst does not cause any symptoms, no treatment is required. Small cysts can disappear spontaneously without treatment. If treatment is considered necessary, a number of options may be considered, including: Without local anaesthetic With local anaesthetic ",

        "Perioral dermatitis": "Also known as periorificial dermatitis, steroid induced rosacea, “muzzle rash” What is it? Perioral dermatitis is a common inflammatory rash that occurs around the mouth area. Other affected areas include around the nose, chin and eyes. Perioral dermatitis affects women more than men and is frequently associated with topical steroid medication usage. Fortunately, perioral dermatitis is responsive to treatment and recurrence is rare. What causes perioral dermatitis? The cause of perioral dermatitis is unknown however several factors may play a role in the development of this condition, including: What does perioral dermatitis look like? Perioral dermatitis presents as multiple red pimple-like bumps that tend to group around the mouth, nose and chin.  The skin around the eyes is occasionally affected. If the lip area is affected, the lip line is classically spared. The overlying skin may be red, dry and flaky. This condition is more common in women than men. Children can also be affected. Perioral dermatitis may be symptomless however burning, tightness and itchiness are common. Perioral dermatitis frequently starts off from an unrelated rash or skin irritation. Topical creams, most often corticosteroid and over the counter preparations, are then used. This leads to an outbreak of perioral dermatitis which then seems to be less red with further steroid usage. Ceasing topical steroids generally leads to a flare-up which then encourages further steroid use. Hence a vicious cycle of steroid use is set up. How is it diagnosed? No tests are usually necessary.  Most cases of perioral dermatitis can be diagnosed from a history and examination. In resistant cases, allergic contact dermatitis should be considered and investigated through targeted patch testing. Consider specialist referral. How is it treated? If steroid cream use is suspected, stop using the cream altogether. A rebound or flare-up of perioral dermatitis is to be expected after you stop using the cream, however do not be tempted to re-use the steroid cream again.  If steroid nasal sprays or inhalers are suspected, try rinsing the face and mouth after use. Simplify all skin care. Use soap substitutes and gentle skin care products. If possible, keep make-up use to a minimum. Oral antibiotics are the most effective treatment. They are effective through anti-inflammatory mechanisms and not through their anti-microbial actions.  Usually a 6 week course is prescribed. An additional 6 week course may be considered if the rash recurs. Tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics are most frequently used, including doxycycline, minocycline and erythromycin (the only option in children whose teeth have not formed). Topical medications are not as effective as oral medications.  Examples include erythromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole and azelaic acid.  These may be preferred in pregnancy. Topical pimecrolimus has also been used however this medication has occasionally been reported to be the trigger for perioral dermatitis and should be used with caution. Erythromycin suspension for 4 to 8 weeks is recommended in the treatment of children under the age of 8. What is the likely outcome of perioral dermatitis? Perioral dermatitis carries an excellent prognosis and recurrences are rare providing initiating factors are avoided. Most individuals will start to improve within a few weeks of treatment. If perioral dermatitis recurs, a further 6 week course of antibiotics is recommended. The use of a simplified skin care regime, coupled with avoidance of topical corticosteroids and heavy make-up can prevent recurrences. Consider referral to a dermatologist for resistant cases. Prevention, by avoiding strong topical corticosteroids on the face, is the best option. This information has been written by Dr Davin S.

        "What causes Hori’s naevus?": "Genetics and hormones play a role in the development of Hori’s Naevus. In normal skin, melanin-producing pigment cells (melanocytes) are present only in the upper layer of skin (the epidermis) and hair follicles. However, when these cells are present in the underlying area of skin (the dermis) it causes a condition known as dermal melanocytosis. Dermal melanocytosis is a spectrum of conditions and includes Mongolian spots, naevus of Ota, Hori’s Naevus and naevus of Ito. When melanin is present more deeply in the skin, it results in the perceived colour changes from black-brown to blue-grey. ",

Most individuals report good results following laser therapy. Various pigmentation lasers can be used such as Q-Switched (nanosecond) or Pico-second lasers. Multiple laser treatment sessions usually required and temporary tanning of the skin (post-inflammatory pigmentation) can complicate treatment. However, this usually settles over time. The risk of post-inflammatory pigmentation may increase if melasma is present. It is important that the melasma also receives medical attention. ",

        "How are naevus of Ota (NOO) and Ito (NOI) treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Camouflage with makeup is often considered as a treatment for NOO and NOI, but achieving cosmetically acceptable skin colour matching can be difficult. Laser is often the main treatment used for both these conditions. Quality(Q)-switched lasers (Nd:YAG (1064nm and/or 532nm), Ruby (694nm) or Alexandrite (755nm)) are usually used to lighten pigmentation, but several treatment courses are required.

        "Naevus sebaceous": "What is naevus sebaceous? Naevus sebaceous is a birthmark usually seen on the scalp or face of newborns and infants. In rare cases it can be present on other areas of the body. Naevus sebaceous can be thought of as being similar to a birthmark but made up of sebaceous cells. What causes naevus sebaceous? Naevus sebaceous is caused by a malformation of a small part of the skin due to minor genetic changes. It occurs randomly and in the vast majority of cases has no implications on the general health of the child. What does naevus sebaceous look like? Naevus sebaceous is usually noticed at birth as a skin coloured or yellow, slightly raised, waxy and pebbly change on the skin. The shape is often oval or in a straight line and can have irregular borders. The lesion often thickens as a child grows and it can develop a rough texture. On the scalp, the naevus usually remains hairless. What other problems can occur with naevus sebaceous? Other benign (non-cancerous) skin growths can develop on top of the naevus sebaceous as a child grows. This is thought to occur in up to 50% of cases. In less than 1% of cases a basal cell carcinoma can grow within the lesion. However these tend to occur in adults rather than in children. In very rare cases naevus sebaceous birthmarks are very large and extensive and can be associated with Schimmelpenning syndrome or phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica. These are conditions where other abnormalities are also often present such as other birthmarks, neurological, heart, skeletal and eye problems. How is naevus sebaceous diagnosed? Naevus sebaceous is usually diagnosed by its typical clinical appearance. A biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis in certain cases. How is naevus sebaceous treated? Treatment is not always necessary. Lesions can be monitored for any change by the treating dermatologist. It is also important to check for any change within the lesion and bring this to the attention of the dermatologist. Surgical removal, if deemed necessary, is often delayed until later in childhood or adolescence. However, lesions on the face are usually removed earlier in childhood. This is especially true if lesions are close to the eyes, nose or lips where they may enlarge and cause problems with vision, breathing or eating.

        "Naevus spilus": "Also known as speckled lentiginous naevus, zosteriform lentiginous naevus What is naevus spilus? Naevus spilus is a type of birthmark that consists of a flat brown background patch containing darker brown spots or tiny bumps. What causes it? Naevus spilus is caused by a localised defect in melanoblasts (the forerunners of pigment cells) that populate a particular area of the skin. There is some controversy as to whether naevus spilus represents a birthmark known as a variant of a congenital melanocytic naevus, or it is acquired later on in life. What does it look like? A variable number of black, brown or red-brown spots or tiny lumps are seen within a flat patch of tan-to-brown hyperpigmentation. The “background” tan patch is usually noted at birth, or soon after, while the spots within the patch appear over time. Any site of the body might be affected. The spots or bumps within the background stain are usually moles called pigmented naevi. There are many types of these including junctional, compound and intradermal naevi, Spitz and blue naevi. There are reports of cutaneous melanoma arising within a naevus spilus but this is extremely rare. How is naevus spilus diagnosed? Diagnosis is by visual inspection. A skin biopsy will be needed if atypical features are present or there is a history of recent change. How is naevus spilus treated? Initially, naevus spilus should be photographed to document stability of the lesions. A biopsy will be needed for any suspicious areas. Affected individuals should check the area as part of their regular full body self-examination and note any changes. Laser treatment may be considered when the appearance of the naevus is of cosmetic concern. Both the Q-switched ruby and Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers have been used to treat the background hyperpigmentation and the speckles of naevus spilus. However, results are variable – some lesions respond well while others do not. Regular self-examination is still necessary, even after successful treatment. You should seek medical advice for any unusual or new changes in appearance.

        "Nails": "Introduction Nails are specialised protective plates of hard keratin (protein that helps form the nail plate) that develop from the epidermis (outermost layer of the skin) overlying the small bones at the ends of the fingers and toes.  The keratinocytes (surface skin cells) are the main cell of the epidermis (see Skin structure and function) Nails grow continuously. Fingernails take about 6 months to grow from the cuticle to the tip (3 mm per month). Toenails grow more slowly (1 mm/month). It can take 12 months for a toenail to regrow after being removed. Toenails become thicker as they grow out.  It is believed that repeated minor pressure from footwear while walking causes this thickening. What are the parts that make up the nail? The nail unit is made up of several components which form, support, protect and frame the nail itself.  These include the nail matrix, nail plate, cuticle, nail bed and nail folds.  The nail unit protects fingertips, enhances fine touch and is important as a cosmetic structure. What causes nail changes or abnormalities to nails? Age, medications and diseases may influence the growth rate of nails. Changes in the nail may be caused by an injury, fungal disease or other skin conditions such as psoriasis or eczema. Some diseases affect all parts of the nail unit and other conditions affect only one area. The following information explains the most common nail abnormalities. Common nail abnormalities A normal nail is translucent and its pink colour comes from vessels in the specialised skin (nail bed) underneath. The end of the nail appears white because of the air beneath it. If the nail plate becomes separated from the nail bed, the white colour will extend down the nail.  Excessive cleaning under the free edge of the nail can create this problem. Nail cosmetics, particularly nail hardeners containing formalin, and the application of artificial nails, can cause separation of the nail plate from the nail bed. Some antibiotics may cause onycholysis if the nails are exposed to the sun. Chronic eczema of the fingers can cause a build-up of scale under the free edge of the nails along with onycholysis. Ridging in nails can be either along (longitudinal) or across (transverse) the nail.  Longitudinal riding normally becomes more prominent with age but can also be associated with medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lichen planus and injury to the nail. Transverse depressions often appear some weeks after an illness or fever and grow out with the nail.  They can also be caused by long-standing or severe eczema around the nail fold or trauma from pushing back the cuticle. In this condition there is splitting of the free end of the nail into layers. It is most commonly seen in people who frequently immerse their hands in water as part of their work or home duties. Thickening of the nail can occur as a result of dermatological or general medical disease. It is most frequently seen in the toenails of the elderly and often results from long-term use of ill-fitting footwear and neglect of the nails. Psoriasis and a number of other skin conditions can affect the nail, often leading to thickening of the nail. A fungal nail infection can also lead to thickening of the nail plate. If a fungal nail infection is suspected, your medical practitioner may suggest taking a sample of the thickened nail to be analysed by a laboratory. If a fungal infection is confirmed as the cause of thickened nails, oral treatment may be required particularly if the nail shape is distorted and interferes with wearing footwear. Individuals with darker coloured skin may see one or more longitudinal bands of pigment extending the whole length of the nail. This can vary in colour and width. If there is only a single band on one nail, it may be necessary to do a biopsy to exclude melanoma (a form of skin cancer) of the nail bed. Drugs and other diseases may also cause multiple bands of discolouration. Medications, chemicals from hair dyes and nail varnish, nicotine and creams such as dithranol (a medication used to treat psoriasis) can cause discolouration of the nail. Antibiotics can cause nail lifting and brownish discolouration of the nail plate.  Anti-malarial medications and agents used in chemotherapy may also cause discolouration. Inflammation of the nail fold (paronychia) can be acute or chronic. Most paronychial inflammation is seen in combination with dermatitis/eczema of the hands – the cuticle is destroyed and a groove forms where the skin and nail meet. Water from showering, frequent hand washing or wet work accumulates in the groove and moisture-loving bacteria (pseudomonas) or yeast organisms often colonise this area and aggravate the eczema and cause inflammation in the nail fold. All nail folds may be involved. This inflammation is commonly seen in nurses, hospitality workers, mothers with small children and anyone involved in activities where nails are frequently immersed in water for periods of time. Damage to the cuticle from over-zealous manicuring can also predispose a person to develop this form of inflammation. Bacterial infection of the nail fold may occur after an injury to this area as a result of staphyloccal or streptococcal infection. It causes redness, swelling, tenderness and pain of the lateral or proximal nail fold (see diagram), sometimes with pus formation. This form of paronychia does not occur as frequently as the more chronic paronychia associated with eczema. Nail biting is associated with paronychia around the nail folds and leads to deformity of the nail plate. Wart infections around and under the nail are more frequent in nail biters. Constant pressure on one area of the nails can produce a longitudinal or a thickened depression along the nail.  Adhesives used to attach artificial nails can be associated with nail and skin inflammation. A blow to a nail may cause bleeding under the nail. If this causes a lot of pain, a hole may be made in the nail plate to drain the blood (known as a subungual haematoma). Skin diseases with nail involvement Many nail abnormalities stem from skin diseases which need to be treated to enable the nails to return to normal. Some common examples include: Psoriasis can cause small pinhead pits in the nail plate, separation of the nail plate from the nail bed (onycholysis) and thickening of the nail. Psoriasis of the toenails can not be easily distinguished from a fungal infection. When the fingertips and surrounding skin are affected by eczema, swelling and inflammation of the nail fold tissues (paronychia) may develop.  This may be made worse if a secondary yeast infection develops. A build-up of skin cells (scaling) may occur under the free edge of the nail plate. Paronychia may develop in infants who suck their thumbs/fingers. If the eczema is ongoing for some months, horizontal ridging of the nail plate may occur. Nails can be infected by fungi. The nail plate becomes thickened, crumbly and discoloured. Nail infection occurs most commonly in the big toenail. Injury, psoriasis and some inherited disorders may produce similar changes in the nail. If there is no history of these conditions and a clinical examination is not conclusive, then a fungal culture from the affected nail(s) will need to be taken. Nail clippings and samples of the debris under the nail will be collected and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative fungus. Oral antifungal medication may be required to treat the infection. Affected people often have frequent recurrent infections. Observing the following simple precautions will reduce the frequency of recurrent infections: Alopecia areata can be associated with a very regular geometric pitting of the nail plate.  Occasionally the entire surface of the nail becomes rough with marked longitudinal ridging of the nail (trachyonychia). This is most commonly seen in children. Viral warts may occur in, around, or under the nail plate and may result in nail deformity. Mucous cysts (they are usually seen in association with arthritis of the finger joints) can occur towards the end of the finger and this can lead to a longitudinal depression (like a gutter) developing in the nail plate.  In rare cases skin cancers can occur in the nail plate area and any non-healing, growing, bleeding or discoloured area should be checked your doctor. What should you do if you have a nail problem? Discuss nail problems with your general practitioner. A referral to a dermatologist may be needed.

        "Nappy rash": "What is nappy rash? Nappy rash is a common, irritant dermatitis occurring in the nappy area, mostly in children under the age of two years. It is not primarily an infection or the result of poor hygiene. There are now fewer cases of severe nappy rash because of the increased use of superabsorbent disposable nappies. What causes nappy rash? Nappy rash is an irritant dermatitis occurring in the nappy area. The initiating factor is prolonged wetness (usually from urine) to the skin. This leads to increased friction damage (where the nappy rubs against the wet skin) and a decrease in the normal barrier function of the skin. This allows the skin to overact to ongoing irritation and leads to progression of the rash. Secondary infection can sometimes occur. What does nappy rash look like? The involved skin of the nappy area appears as red, inflamed and moist patches. Sometimes the patches can be scaly. In more severe cases there may be superficial ulcers. The deeper folds are generally spared. The rash may be itchy but is often asymptomatic. It is possible for nappy rash to be infected, most commonly with a yeast organism called candida (thrush). In this type of nappy rash the patches of skin are often bright red and may extend to involve the body folds as well as the other surfaces. Small red isolated dots, called “satellite lesions” are characteristic of this type of infection. Oral candida (thrush) can be present in some cases. How is nappy rash prevented and treated?

        "What is necrobiosis lipoidica?": "Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare skin condition which typically affects the lower legs, but can affect other parts of the body. It is characterized by shiny red-yellow plaques which usually enlarge and persist for years. ",
        "Who gets necrobiosis lipoidica?": "Necrobiosis is three times more common in women than in men. 1 It affects all races and can occur at any age, although most commonly occurring in young adults and those of middle age. ",
        "What causes necrobiosis lipoidica?": "The cause of necrobiosis lipoidica is not yet completely understood. It is often seen in individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Individuals that develop this skin condition who are not known to be diabetic at the time, often develop diabetes in the future. It is thought to occur due to damage to the skin as well as changes in the small blood vessels of the skin, caused by excess sugar. ",
        "What does necrobiosis lipoidica look like?": "Necrobiosis lipoidica typically starts as small, red, raised areas on one or both lower legs. Similar spots may develop on other parts of the body. These spots tend to grow slowly over several months and may join up to form large, flat and irregularly shaped lesions. These larger lesions usually have a well-defined red border with a shiny yellow centre. The skin in the centre is typically very thin with visible blood vessels. These plaques may persist for many years. ",
        "How is necrobiosis lipoidica diagnosed?": "A skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. As the presence of necrobiosis lipoidica can usually indicate an underlying disease process, other tests looking for diseases such as diabetes or insulin resistance may also be performed. ",
        "How is necrobiosis lipoidica treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Necrobiosis lipoidica does not always require treatment, especially if the individual is not bothered by it cosmetically and it is not painful or ulcerated. However, if that is not the case, treatment is best started in the early stages of this condition before scarring has developed. Topical or injected corticosteroids are often used as the first line of treatment. If this fails other therapies may include: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of necrobiosis lipoidica?": "Necrobiosis lipoidica is typically a chronic condition with variable progression and scarring. In rare cases, the lesion may heal on its own. However, the skin overlying the lesion will be thinner and have permanent pigmentary changes. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Necrolytic Migratory Erythema": "Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a type of fat inflammation (panniculitis). It is a rare and transient condition that results in the development of red, firm and deep lumps in the fatty layer of the skin. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn typically affects full-term neonates in the first 2-3 weeks of life. The prognosis is generally favourable and treatment unnecessary. Subcutaneous fat necrosis mainly affects the brown fat in neonates. Brown fat is a type of fat that helps to generate heat under cold conditions. Triggers of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn may include: However, most babies who are exposed to these triggers do not get subcutaneous fat necrosis. The rash usually looks like red, firm and deep lumps or large areas of raised skin. The cheek, shoulders, back, buttocks and thighs are the most commonly affected body sites. The most important complication of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is high calcium levels (hypercalcemia). This may develop either during the acute phases of the condition or delayed for up to months later. Hypercalcemia may be completely asymptomatic or be associated with fevers, irritability, vomiting, seizures, increased urination, vomiting, kidney problems and even death if severe. Other problems that rarely may occur include: The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist. A skin biopsy may be taken to confirm the diagnosis, which would show inflammation of the fat in a pattern called “lobular panniculitis”. The condition tends to resolve spontaneously within 6 weeks without treatment. If severe, systemic steroids can be used to control the inflammation. Longitudinal monitoring of calcium levels (for at least 4 months) is recommended. The prognosis of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is overall favourable. Rarely, some lesions may end up shrunken-looking (atrophic) or slightly pigmented. As mentioned, hypercalcemia needs to be monitored even after the disappearance of the skin lesions.

        "Neonatal and infantile acne": "Also known as neonatal acne, neonatal cephalic pustulosis What‘s the difference between neonatal and infantile acne? Neonatal acne affects babies in the first 3 months of life. About 20% of healthy newborn babies may develop superficial pustules mostly on the face but also on the neck and upper trunk. There are no comedones (whiteheads or blackheads) present.  Neonatal acne usually resolves without treatment. Infantile acne is the development of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) with papules and pustules and occasionally nodules and cysts that may lead to scarring.  It may occur in children from a few months of age and may last till 2 years of age. It is more common in boys. What causes infantile acne? Infantile acne is thought to be a result of testosterone temporarily causing an over-activity of the skin’s oil glands. In susceptible children this may stimulate the development of acne. Most children are however otherwise healthy with no hormonal problem. The acne reaction usually subsides within 2 years. What does infantile acne look like? Infantile acne presents with whiteheads, blackheads, red papules and pustules, nodules and sometimes cysts that may lead to long term scarring. It most commonly affects the cheeks, chin and forehead with less frequent involvement of the body. How is infantile acne diagnosed? The diagnosis is made clinically and investigations are not usually required. However, if older children (2 to 6 years) develop acne and other symptoms such as body odour, breast and genital development, then hormonal screening blood tests should be considered. How is infantile acne treated? Treatment is usually with topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, retinoid cream (adapalene) or antibiotic gel (erythromycin). Oral treatments such as antibiotics (erythromycin), or very occasionally isotretinoin, may be needed if the condition is severe in order to prevent permanent scarring. What is the likely outcome of infantile acne? The majority of children require only topical treatments to control the acne and it usually subsides by the age of 2 years. Children who have been affected by infantile acne may develop problematic adolescent acne.

        "Neonatal lupus erythematosus": "What is neonatal lupus? Neonatal lupus is an autoimmune disease. It occurs when an antibody is transferred from the mother to the baby. The antibody can affect the baby’s skin, heart, liver, blood and brain. Neonatal lupus is rare with an incidence of 1 in 20,000 pregnancies. It most commonly presents with skin rashes or heart block (where the electrical signals in the heart are disrupted). Most mothers (60%) do not have any symptoms and are often unaware that they have a circulating autoantibody. What causes neonatal lupus? Neonatal lupus is caused by a circulating autoantibody. In approximately 80% of cases, the Ro antibody is positive. In 50% of cases, the La antibody is positive. In a recent retrospective review from Thailand, 100% of reported mothers had an antinuclear antibody (ANA) in their blood. This is the antibody found in a number of autoimmune conditions such as lupus erythematosus or Sjogren’s syndrome. In rare cases an anti U1RNP antibody is present. What does neonatal lupus look like? Neonatal lupus in the skin can resemble skin lupus seen in adults. In most cases red, ring-like lesions are seen on the skin. They may be scaly in areas affected by the sun. The image below shows the classic periocular (“raccoon eye” or “owl eye”) erythema. The classic onset of neonatal lupus is 1 to 2 months of age (although it can be present at birth). After the rash resolves, some children have residual post-inflammatory pigmentation, prominent blood vessels (telangiectasias) and pale scar-like areas. There is heart disease in approximately 60% of cases and this is the major cause of the 10-30% mortality rate. Congenital heart block, heart failure and structural heart defects are seen. However, a slow heart beat is usually picked up before birth on the 18 week ultrasound. If it is not present at birth it is much less likely to be a problem. Liver abnormalities are seen in around 50% of cases and blood abnormalities in 35%. In rare cases aseptic meningitis, myelopathy and pneumonitis are present. How is neonatal lupus diagnosed? Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests of both mother and baby. The blood tests will distinguish it from other conditions which may resemble neonatal lupus such as: other photosensitive dermatoses (including genodermatoses); atopic dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis; tinea; urticaria; acute haemorrhagic oedema of infancy; or erythema multiforme. A skin biopsy may not be needed if the baby has the classic ring shaped rash, and the mother has the typical blood test findings. What other tests may be needed? For the child with confirmed cutaneous (skin) neonatal lupus, a physical examination including monitoring of the heart rate is required. An electrocardiogram may be required. Screening for other forms of the disease is recommended with blood tests such as full blood count, kidney and liver function tests. The child may need to be referred to a paediatric rheumatologist and cardiologist. How is neonatal lupus treated? Sun protection is important and mild topical steroids can be trialled for skin lesions if discomfort is present or for cosmetic reasons. Pulse dye laser treatment may be used for residual telangiectasias. Depending on the degree of organ involvement, oral or systemic steroids may be required. Cardiac involvement may require pacemaker placement or medication to treat heart failure. Structural defects may require surgical management. Referral to an immunologist or rheumatologist with experience in this area is required to evaluate active autoimmune disease and discuss management of future pregnancies. Preconception oral plaquenil can reduce the risk of neonatal cardiac lupus and, if detected during pregnancy, IVIG, oral prednisolone or plasmapheresis may be given. Close ultrasound monitoring of the foetus is required. This information has been written by Dr Rachael Foster\nUpdated 15 June 2015 Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Lichen simplex chronicus": "Also known as neurodermatitis What is lichen simplex chronicus? Lichen simplex chronicus is characterised by thickening of the skin due to chronic rubbing or scratching. Exaggerated skin markings termed “lichenification” are common. Lichen simplex chronicus is more common in females. It is also associated with atopic disorders (asthma, eczema, hayfever). What causes it? The cause of lichen simplex chronicus is not well understood but it is initiated by itching. Some people may have no underlying cause or primary skin disease. In others, there is an associated skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis. It can start from a small itchy condition such as an insect bite and continued rubbing and scratching results in lichen simplex chronicus. The condition is thought to be due to an alteration in the nerve fibres resulting in a heightened sensitivity to the itch sensation. This results in a vicious cycle of itching and scratching which becomes difficult to break. In some people, stress or anxiety can play a role in both initiating the process and exacerbating the condition. What does it look like? The affected skin is thickened and leathery, occasionally with surface scaling. Deep scratch marks or scars often accompany the condition. There may be redness due to inflammation and pigmentary changes can be seen, especially in darker skin types. The skin markings are often pronounced in affected areas. There may be broken hairs or a lack of hair within affected areas due to chronic scratching. How is it diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical appearance of the condition. However, skin scrapings may be taken to exclude a fungal infection. Bacterial swabs are taken if secondary infection is suspected (yellow crusting, weeping). A skin biopsy may be needed in atypical cases. How is it treated? Breaking the itch scratch cycle is the key to managing the condition. To reduce itching, an anti-inflammatory such as a strong corticosteroid cream may be used. Physically covering the affected areas with specialised bandaging is helpful in reducing subconscious scratching and helping topical treatments work more effectively. Sedating antihistamines can help reduce sleep disturbance and subconscious scratching in sleep. Other anti-inflammatory treatments include topical calcineurin inhibitors and intralesional steroid injections. Topical menthol or tar preparations can also help reduce itching. In extensive or recalcitrant cases, phototherapy(light treatment) or oral medications such as methotrexate, cyclosporine or oral steroids may be needed. Any underlying skin conditions including dryness of the skin should be addressed. Using moisturisers regularly and avoiding soap is recommended. It is important to keep nails short to minimise further skin trauma. What is the likely outcome of lichen simplex chronicus? The condition can be persistent and is prone to recurrence. Emotional stress can lead to exacerbations. This information has been written by Dr Yin Vun\nUpdated 11 November 2015 Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Spider naevi": "Also known as spider naevus, spider angioma, nevus araneus What are spider naevi? Spider naevi are prominent blood vessels affecting up to 10% of the population. They usually occur as single or multiple blood vessels on the face, chest and neck areas. As the name suggests, spider naevi look like central red lumps with blood vessels radiating in a spider web-like pattern from the centre. Spider naevi are readily and safely treated with vascular lasers. What causes spider naevi? It is not known why most spider naevi occur. However, growth factors such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factors) are known to play a role in the occurrence of vascular lesions. In certain cases, the occurrence of spider naevi can be caused by: What do they look like? Spider naevi, as the name suggests, are red pin-point blood vessels measuring 1 to 3 mm in diameter which  have a feeding blood vessel in the centre with smaller vessels radiating outwards in a spider web-like pattern. Spider naevi usually occur as single or multiple blood vessels on the cheeks, nose and neck areas. Application of pressure to the centre of the blood vessel causes temporary improvement. Release of pressure causes rapid re-filling of the vessels.   In some cases multiple spider naevi are seen on the chest and shoulder areas during pregnancy. Spider naevi may develop in both adults and children. How is spider naevi diagnosed? Formal tests are not usually required. However, spider naevi occurring in the mouth or on the lips may require further testing. How are they treated? Unless a child feels self-conscious about the appearance of the condition, treatment of spider naevi in children is usually unnecessary. In certain cases, the condition will resolve with age.  However, if naevi are persistent, most children over the age of 8 will tolerate treatment with a vascular laser. Spider naevi associated with pregnancy may fade within 2 to 6 months postpartum (after giving birth). Laser treatment is considered the gold standard in treating spider naevi and many different types of laser treatments are available. One to two pulses will usually resolve up to 90% of spots. For deeper spider naevi, or for people with darker skin types, longer pulse lasers can be considered. This information has been written by Dr Davin S.

        "Port-wine Stain": "Also known as … Capillary Malformation in modern terminology, as well as Nevus Flammeus A port-wine stain is a pink to red flat patch on the skin which has well-defined edges.  It is a true birthmark present in 3 to 5 per 1000 newborn babies. It is permanent and its area will increase in proportion to general body growth. Port-wine stain should not be confused with other pink patches present at birth such as the stork bite mark. The stork bite mark (angel’s kiss, salmon patch) on the central forehead is very common and will usually go away by itself in the first or second year of life. Port-wine stain is in the family of disorders known as vascular malformations. These are not the same as the far more common infantile haemangioma (strawberry birthmark) which is in the family of benign vascular tumours. Infantile haemangiomas are not usually present at birth. They have an early growth phase, become raised, and eventually shrink and disappear. Our understanding of the condition remains limited. The birthmark is thought to be due to a disturbance in the behaviour of blood vessels. The nerve control of blood flow is deficient and this results in blood flow being at maximum all the time. The capillaries within the port-wine stain remain wide open and this produces the typical red appearance. Normal skin will become red, for example, after sunburn, as a result of increased blood flow into the area. However, once the burn heals the blood vessels reduce to normal flow and the redness disappears. This normal behaviour cannot occur in a port-wine stain. Recently an abnormality in the GNAQ gene has been discovered in port-wine stain areas. However, this will need further corroborative studies. Port-wine stain is not hereditary. At birth, the port-wine stain is typically pink to red.  Although it is most commonly seen on the face, it can be present on any part of the body.  In some cases the port-wine stain will thicken and become darker in colour later in adult life. The thickening can be in the form of small dark lumps or the whole stain may thicken. Port-wine stain can be associated with certain syndromes. However, it is important to understand that the port-wine stain does not cause the syndrome but is simply a symptom of the condition. The diagnosis is usually obvious from the appearance of the stain and a history of presence at birth without further disproportionate growth. Further investigations will be required if an associated syndrome is suspected. Port-wine stain can be treated with laser. The specific laser used depends on whether the stain is in the flat pink stage or the bluish thickened appearance that sometimes develops in older adults. Treatment of flat pink childhood port-wine stain Treatment is recommended, particularly if the port-wine stain involves the face as it can be associated with teasing at school.  Treatment is best commenced as early possible as multiple treatment sessions are necessary. If a general anaesthetic is needed, this risk needs to be considered. There is a trend to commence treatment as soon as possible after birth. Treatment is initially given at intervals of between 2 to 4 weeks. Under the age of about 4 months this can be done without general anesthetic as the treatment is not particularly painful. As children become older, treatment generally requires general anesthetic. Treatment of adult-type thicker darker lesions Thicker lesions may be more resistant to treatment. They require more deeply penetrating laser and light systems. Depending on availability and preference, these systems include long pulsed Alexandrite laser, long pulsed Nd: YAG laser and some IPL systems. Safety of laser treatment Treatment of childhood port-wine stains has a very high safety profile with the use of modern lasers that have skin cooling. There are very rare instances of minor blistering and scarring. The more deeply penetrating lasers, as used in adult stains, carry a slightly higher risk of minor scarring.

        "What is atypical mycobacterial infection?": "Infectious organisms known as Atypical Mycobacteria (ATM) cause common skin infections seen in Australia. Mycobacteria have a thick waxy coat surrounding their cell walls to protect them in harsh environments. Individuals can get ATM infections from various environmental sources such as soil, water (e.g., swimming pools, aquariums, spas and ponds), food products and common animals (domestic and wild). Mycobacteria are highly resistant to medications due to their thick protective cell wall. They are also highly resistant to drying and can survive outside the body without moisture for a long time. Mycobacterium ulcerans (M.ulcerans), a common type of ATM, can cause Buruli ulcer. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causing tuberculosis in the lung, and Mycobacterium leprae, causing leprosy, are also mycobacteria that can result in more serious infections. ",
        "Who gets atypical mycobacterial infection?": "ATM can affect individuals of any age, but young children, and those with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable. Individuals with medical equipment inside them and those who have recently undergone surgical or non-surgical procedures are also at higher risk. ",
        "What causes atypical mycobacterial infection?": "A group of infectious organisms causes ATM infections. There are different species, such as Mycobacterium marinum, and Mycobacterium chelonae. ",
        "What does atypical mycobacterial infection look like?": "The clinical appearance of an ATM infection varies, depending on the infecting ATM. An initial sign of an ATM infection is skin lesions at the infection’s entry site.  Some individuals may have thickened lumps or plaques causing no symptoms, usually growing slowly. Some of these lumps can become ulcers, such as Buruli ulcers. ",
        "How is atypical mycobacterial infection diagnosed?": "Along with clinical suspicious, diagnosis usually involves taking a sample of the skin lesions, known as a biopsy. Culturing the tissue from the biopsy helps grow the bacteria. Special tests like polymerase chain reaction identify the presence of the ATM’s genetic material. This will help determine the specific bacteria causing the skin infection. ",
        "How is atypical mycobacterial infection treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The individuals’ immune status, as well as the severity of the ATM infection, the specific bacteria and antibiotic sensitivity are important factors to consider. Medical therapy consists of antibiotics, which are used in combination with each other. Antibiotics may include rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Individuals may require surgical therapy along with medical therapy such as drainage of abscesses and removal of foreign bodies. The condition may be more challenging to treat if individuals are undernourished, have HIV or are on medications that weaken their immune system. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of atypical mycobacterial infection?": "Although ATM infections are challenging to treat, it is important to note that these are low-grade infections that are curable with treatment. However, knowing the specific bacteria is essential before starting treatment. Individuals may undergo prolonged treatment for 6-12 months or even longer. They may often require consultations with infectious disease specialists. An individuals’ response to treatment also influences the outcome.  Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a rare liver condition which causes an itchy skin. There is no rash but the skin may show scratch marks (excoriations) or become yellow (jaundiced). This condition typically develops late in pregnancy and resolves within days after the baby is born. Closer monitoring of the pregnancy is recommended as this condition can have serious effects on the unborn baby.  The cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is unknown. The liver becomes less able to clear certain substances. Bile acids and bilirubin accumulate in the blood and cause an itchy skin. This condition sometimes runs in families. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically occurs in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Symptoms often begin on the palms of hands and soles of feet after which a widespread itchy skin develops. The skin may appear normal or show scratch marks and turn yellow as the condition progresses. Some women experience fatigue, nausea or abdominal discomfort. This condition is potentially serious for the unborn baby with an increased risk of foetal distress, preterm labour and stillbirth. In severe cases the mother may be less able to absorb vitamin K causing her to be prone to bleeding around the time of delivery. A diagnosis is made on a special blood test that shows an elevation in bile acid levels.  Liver function tests may be abnormal. A coagulation profile is often included in blood investigations to assess the risk of bleeding. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is usually treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, an oral medication that lowers bile acid levels, relieves itch and improves foetal outcome. Treatment should be started promptly and continued until the baby is born. Careful obstetric and paediatric care is important and babies may be delivered early. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy improves within a few days of delivery.  However it usually recurs in subsequent pregnancies and may also recur with commencement of the oral contraceptive pill.

        "Orf": "Also known as … Scabby Mouth, Sheep Pox or Ecthyma contagiosum What is orf? Orf is an infection caused by the parapox virus which primarily infects sheep and goats. The condition is most commonly seen in animal handlers, butchers and farm workers. Anyone can become infected by touching the affected animals or by contact with infected pastures. Orf occurs worldwide. Orf is spread through direct contact with lesions of infected animals or through fomites found in animal enclosures (touching contaminated surfaces or particles). Typically, infected animals have warty sores and scabs on their muzzle and, less commonly, on their lower legs and teats. However, some infected animals may not have any visible sores at all. Orf lesions are usually seen on the fingers or hands of an individual who has touched the infected animal (e.g. bottle feeding or shearing the animal). Occasionally the orf lesions can also be seen on the face or other parts of the body that may have been in contact with the infected animal. The orf lesion evolves through distinctive stages and can be painful.  A red bump develops about 1 week after contact with the virus. An infected person may experience mild fever and malaise for the first few days.  Red streaks (infected lymph channels) may be visible on the affected limb and the nearby lymph glands can be enlarged. The red bump may grow from 2 to 5 cm and develop rings of white and red around a central red area, after which it usually becomes a blood/pus/fluid filled blister which can weep and bleed easily.  A dry crust usually develops on top and the lesion then starts to take on a warty appearance.  The lesion will heal without treatment after 4 to 6 weeks, usually without scarring. The infection does not usually spread from person to person. There is no specific treatment as orf usually heals on its own. Appropriate dressing care and pain relief may be given if necessary. Antibiotics may be given if there is a secondary bacterial infection. Those at risk should wear protective non-porous gloves when handling sheep and goats and practise good hand hygiene.

What does palmar hyperhidrosis look like? Palmar hyperhidrosis affects both hands equally and can range from mild clammy hands to severe sweating. It stops when sleep. What other problems can occur with palmar hyperhidrosis? Most cases are not associated with an underlying illness. Sweaty hands can be associated with increased sweating in other parts of the body including underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis), face and scalp (craniofacial hyperhidrosis) and feet (plantar hyperhidrosis). The condition can be very distressing due to its impact on quality of life. How is palmer hyperhidrosis diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made based on a history of excessive sweating. No investigations are needed. Further investigations are considered when larger areas of the body are affected or if hyperhidrosis occurs during sleep. How is it palmer hyperhidrosis treated? Treatment will depend on how severe the sweating is and which previous treatments have been successful. Some mild to moderate cases can respond to topical treatments such as aluminium chloride hexahydrate (Driclor). Driclor should always be applied to skin that is as dry as possible in order to maximise the benefit and minimise potential side effects. Ideally, it should be applied just after a shower prior to bedtime. Dry the area off with a hairdryer on the cool setting then apply Driclor. Wash your hands first thing in the morning with plain water (no soap). If irritation develops, applying a corticosteroid cream intermittently can be useful (this needs to used be under the guidance of a health professional). Anticholinergic creams such as glycopyrolate (0.5-3%) can also be effective. A compounding pharmacist can make up these creams. Side effects are uncommon. How often the cream is applied will depend on the individual. Iontophoresis may be considered for cases which do not respond to topical treatments. Treatments are individualised. The affected area is immersed in tap water, salty water or glycopyrrolate solution. Then a gentle electric current is passed across the skin surface for 10 to 20 minutes. Glycopyrrolate iontophoresis has the highest success rate – up to 80% of affected people respond well to this treatment. The time between treatments will vary. Treatments will need to be repeated every 2 to14 days. Botox injections can treat sweaty hands safely and effectively. However, the treatment is not subsidised under Medicare-PBS and the cost limits its wider use. Most treatment is performed under a nerve block. Approximately 100 units of botox will be needed in each hand. The treatment is usually effective for 3 to 5 months. Side effects include temporary muscle weakness. Anticholinergic tablets (such as oxybutynin and propantheline bromide) can be useful in treating palmar hyperhidrosis. However, side effects such as constipation, dry mouth and drowsiness are common. Other medications reported to be useful include oral glycopyrrolate (not available in Australia), propranolol, clonazepam and gabapentin. Medications can be a viable short-term option for several days to weeks and give people a “break” from their sweating. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is a surgical treatment option for various forms of hyperhidrosis. It is conducted by a vascular or neurosurgeon under general anaesthesia. It has a very high success rate for treating palmar hyperhidrosis but carries a significant risk of compensatory or “rebound” sweating. Compensatory sweating occurs in areas such as the back or lower limbs weeks to months after ETS surgery. Compensatory hyperhidrosis can be difficult to treat and usually persists for life. An in-depth discussion with your vascular surgeon or neurologist is needed prior to considering ETS surgery. What is the likely outcome of palmar hyperhidrosis? Palmar hyperhidrosis will often need ongoing and persistent treatment. However, some people may notice the amount of sweating decreases as they get older.

        "Palmoplantar keratoderma": "Also known as keratosis palmaris et plantaris What is palmoplantar keratoderma? Palmoplantar keratoderma is the name given to a group of conditions where there is abnormal thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Palmoplantar keratoderma is classified based on whether it is inherited or acquired and on its clinical features. Inherited palmoplantar keratodermas are classified into four different groups: 1)      Diffuse\n2)      Focal\n3)      Punctate\n4)      Transgradient Acquired keratodermas are not inherited and can be categorised based on various causes, as explained below. What causes palmoplantar keratoderma? There are many possible causes for acquired palmoplantar keratodermas including drugs, menopause, chemicals (e.g. arsenic), mechanical stimulation, malnutrition, systemic conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, circulatory disorders), malignancies (e.g. lung cancer, colon cancer, lymphomas), skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema, pityriasis rubra pilaris, lupus erythematosus) and infectious causes (e.g. syphilis, tuberculosis, human papilloma virus). When the condition is inherited, family members will have the same type of palmoplantar keratoderma. Autosomal dominant keratodermas are likely to affect every generation of a family. However, in autosomal recessive keratodermas parents are “carriers” of the defective gene (meaning that they don’t show the disorder on their skin) but may pass it onto their children if both parents are “carriers”. Most inherited cases of the condition are caused by a defective gene producing keratin 9. What does palmoplantar keratoderma look like? In diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, the skin on the palms and or soles appears thickened and may be hard, yellowish in colour. It affects the entire palm or sole. In focal palmoplantar keratoderma, usually only pressure or friction points are affected. In punctate palmoplantar keratoderma there are tiny skin spots on the palms and soles. Transgradient palmoplantar keratoderma is rare. The condition extends onto the backs of the hands or feet. How is palmoplantar keratoderma diagnosed? Palmoplantar keratoderma is diagnosed by a detailed medical history and physical examination. When the condition is severe and hereditary keratoderma is suspected, the affected person maybe referred to a geneticist for further testing. What other problems can occur with palmoplantar keratoderma? Individuals may experience pain when walking, foot odour, excessive sweating or maceration (moist, white and peeling) of the soles or between the toes. Fungal infections and reduced sensation of the fingers or toes may also be present. The condition may also be associated with changes in nails, hair or teeth. Those affected with keratoderma may also suffer psychological stress due to the appearance of their skin. How is palmoplantar keratoderma treated? Inherited palmoplantar keratodermas are not curable but symptoms can be controlled. The aim of treatment is to reduce the thickness of the skin and to soften the skin. Treatment options include regular use of emollients, keratolytics such as salicylic acid or urea, antifungal cream or tablets if indicated, topical retinoids/calcipotriol and systemic retinoids. Regular visits to a podiatry service for physical removal of thickened skin may be recommended, as well as the wearing of an appropriate shoe with customised insoles. Acquired keratodermas will require additional treatment of the underlying cause. What is the likely outcome of palmoplantar keratoderma? Symptoms can be well-managed if suggested treatments are complied with. Regular follow-up with a doctor is important to monitor skin irritation or other adverse effects associated with treatment. Regular blood tests may be required when using oral antifungals and retinoids.  Women of reproductive age should avoid using retinoids and oral antifungals without appropriate contraception.

        "Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP)": "Also known as … Chronic Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis, Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris, persistent palmoplantar pustulosisWhat is palmoplantar pustulosis? Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic pustular condition affecting the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet. It may occur with psoriasis or without any other skin disease. The cause of PPP is not completely understood. PPP affects the eccrine sweat glands which are most common on the palms and soles. It may be autoimmune in origin. Genetic factors are important as several members of some families may be affected. PPP presents as crops of itchy or sore pustules on the palms and/or soles. PPP can occur on one or both hands and/or feet. Scaly red patches may also be seen in association with the pustules. In the more chronic stages of the disease, the skin can be dry and thickened with deep fissures (cracks in the skin). There is usually a sharp demarcation between the normal and affected skin areas. PPP varies in severity and may persist for many years. The discomfort can be considerable, interfering with work and affecting quality of life. A form of PPP which affects the tips of the fingers is called acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau or acropustulosis. It can lead to destruction of the fingernail on affected digits. Certain conditions have been reported to occur in individuals with PPP: In most cases, the diagnosis is made by clinical examination. In rare cases, a biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Skin scrapings can exclude fungal infections that may mimic PPP.  Skin swabs may be taken to exclude a bacterial infection but will be negative in uncomplicated PPP. Treatment of PPP can be difficult. The condition can also respond poorly to therapy. Less severe cases can usually be managed with topical treatments. More severe cases may require physical or systemic therapy. General measures Topical treatments Light treatment Systemic treatment Systemic treatments include tablets or injections that require regular monitoring.

        "Erythema Annulare Centrifugum": "Also known as … Superficial or Deep Gyrate Erythema, Erythema Perstans, Palpable Migrating Erythema What is Erythema Annulare Centrifugum? Erythema Annulare Centrifugum (EAC) refers to an annular (ring-shaped) erythematous (red) skin eruption that tends to spread outwards whilst clearing centrally. The cause of EAC is unknown but it is probably due to a hypersensitivity reaction to a variety of agents including drugs, insect or spider bites, infections (bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal), food ingestion (such as blue cheese), malignancies or some underlying diseases. In most cases no cause will be found for the EAC. Some people with EAC may have no symptoms whilst others experience mild itching associated with the rash. EAC usually begins as a small raised pink-red spot that slowly enlarges forming a ring shape while the central area flattens and clears. There may be an inner rim of scale. Sometimes the lesions do not form complete rings but grow into irregular shapes. As lesions resolve, there is no residual scarring but the skin may temporarily become redder. One or several lesions of EAC may be localised to one area of the body or generalised over many areas. Lesions most often appear on the thighs and legs. They may occur anywhere on the body but typically spare the palms and soles. The diagnosis of EAC is made by clinical examination. Further investigations may be needed to exclude other causes of annular rashes and to look for an underlying cause. In some cases a skin scraping is needed to exclude fungal infections that may mimic EAC. A biopsy of the skin may be needed in some cases. EAC is usually self-limited which means that it usually resolves without treatment. However, eruptions may last from a few weeks to many years. EAC has been known to resolve once the underlying diseases has been treated. The prognosis for EAC is excellent except in rare cases when it is associated with an underlying cancer or disease.

        "Panniculitis": "What is panniculitis? Panniculitis refers to a group of conditions characterised by inflammation of the fat layer below the skin (sub-cutaneous fat). It can be localised to a particular part of the body or involve larger areas. Panniculitis may present as thickening or hardening of the skin. Frequently there are tender or painful nodules, most often on the legs. There is usually also reddening or darkening of the skin. What causes panniculitis? A wide range of conditions may cause panniculitis including potentially life-threatening conditions such as lupus, pancreatic disease and alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency. Panniculitis may also be a reactive process and may occur at a result of infections or intake of certain drugs. There may be an associated vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) as well. Two of the most common causes of panniculitis, erythema nodosum and lipodermatosclerosis are discussed below. Erythema nodosum The most common acute panniculitis is erythema nodosum (EN) which appears as tender, hard lumps typically over the front of the shins. EN is more common in women and typically does not form ulcers. EN is not a disease but a reaction pattern to an underlying condition, a drug or an infection. The eruption generally lasts 3 to 6 weeks but in some cases becomes chronic. It recurs frequently. EN is best treated with supportive care using aspirin, bed rest and compression.  Because damaged fat is very slow to heal, it can take weeks to assess the response to treatment and often months before the lesions totally resolve. Lipodermatosclerosis Lipodermatosclerosis (LDS) means hardening (sclerosis) of fat (lipo-) and skin (-dermato). This condition is seen in late stages of venous disease (varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis). The area just below the calf muscle goes very hard and pigmented and takes on a woody texture. In extreme cases the leg appears as an inverted champagne bottle. People with varicose veins should be aware of the long-term risks of not treating varicose veins and seek help before LDS occurs. Once LDS occurs, treating the underlying veins may prevent LDS from progressing into ulceration but does not necessarily make the skin feel normal again. In other words, when LDS happens, it is permanent in most cases. How is panniculitis diagnosed? Multiple biopsies of skin and fat are often required to identify the underlying condition. Diagnosis is frequently difficult as it requires adequate tissue to be obtained for analysis. A variety of blood tests and other investigations may be required. The presence of panniculitis may represent an underlying disease and other specialists may need to be involved in planning management and treatments. Investigations may be required to exclude, more serious, underlying conditions such as sarcoidosis, scleroderma, lupus or leprosy. How is panniculitis treated? Treatment is directed towards the underlying cause of the condition. Symptoms may be treated with rest and elevation, compression hosiery and analgesics and/or anti-inflammatories. Panniculitis may wax and wane and may take months to years to resolve despite active treatment.

        "Papular Urticaria": "Also known as…Insect bite-induced hypersensitivity What is Papular Urticaria? Papular urticaria is a term used to describe hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction to insect bites manifested by recurrent and persistent itchy lumps or fluid filled blisters. Despite its name, papular urticaria is not a true urticaria (a true urticaria has temporary wheeling or hives that resolve within hours). Papular urticaria is generally thought to be the result of an unusual and abnormal hypersensitivity reaction to bites from insects such as mosquitoes, fleas, mites, bedbugs and particularly bird mites. However, it can be nearly impossible to work out what a person is reacting to. The condition can occur at any age but it is seen most often in children 2 to10 years of age. Adults can be affected but at a much lower rate. The condition is related to an individual’s immune response rather than the insect bite itself. Usually only one member of a family is affected. The condition is not contagious. Papular urticarial begins as very itchy, red and swollen lumps. A water filled blister may develop within 1 to 3 days. When it subsides, it may leave a darkened mark. Scratching leads to crusting, bleeding and ulcers. Infections or persistent scarring may occur especially if the area is scratched deeply and repeatedly. Lesions tend to occur in groups or clusters that are symmetrically distributed. The lesions not only appear at the site of insect bites but also on any part of the body, particularly on exposed areas such as the face, forearms and lower legs. Papular urticaria usually persists for weeks or even months, reactivating when new bites occur. Papular urticaria is usually diagnosed based on a skin examination. Features that suggest an insect bite reaction include grouping of red lumps and bumps that correlate with exposure to insect bites. In some cases, a skin biopsy may be needed. Papular urticaria is usually self-limiting which means that children or affected individuals eventually outgrow it, probably through desensitisation after multiple exposures to insect bites. In rare cases, the condition may recur after months or even years. Preventative measures Symptomatic treatments The condition is usually persistent and commonly recurs. However, individuals develop tolerance to insect bites eventually and symptoms will resolve. Further testing or investigations are not necessary and may be overly invasive.

        "Paraneoplastic pemphigus": "Also known as paraneoplastic autoimmune multi-organ syndrome (PAMS) What is paraneoplastic pemphigus? Paraneoplastic pemphigus is a rare, severe blistering condition of the mucosal surfaces and skin associated with an underlying cancer. What causes paraneoplastic pemphigus? The cancer is thought to trigger paraneoplastic pemphigus but the mechanism is not known. The cancer releases antibodies to particular proteins found in many tissue surfaces which result in the inflammation and blistering. There is a genetic susceptibility in some individuals. What does paraneoplastic pemphigus look like? Intractable and painful sores on the lips and in the mouth (stomatitis) as well as other mucosal linings (e.g. eyes, nose, oesophagus, genitals) are the predominant features of paraneoplastic pemphigus.  The associated discomfort often results in severe exhaustion and a lack of appetite. A skin rash develops later with many different features, possibly including blisters.  It typically involves the face and hands and then spreads to the rest of the body.  The rash often looks like other conditions such as pemphigus, pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, lichen planus or graft versus host disease. Other organ systems may be affected. Secondary infection and septicaemia are common complications. What other problems can occur with paraneoplastic pemphigus? Cancer is associated with all cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus.  In two thirds of these, the cancer is present at the time of diagnosis and the remainder will be identified after diagnosis. The most common associated cancers include:  haematological cancers such as non Hodgkins lymphoma (38.6%), Castleman tumour (18.4%), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (18.4%), Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia (1.2%), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (0.6%) and monoclonal gammopathy (0.6%); and other types of cancer (8.6%) and sarcoma (7%), malignant and benign thymoma (5.5%), and rarely others. How is paraneoplastic pemphigus diagnosed? Skin biopsies are usually required to confirm the diagnosis.  Routine samples are taken. These may show that the cells in the surface skin are not adhering to each other and the underlying deeper skin, in a normal manner. Tests from adjacent but not blistered skin may show immune proteins and another blood complement deposited between cells and along the basement membrane zone. Blood tests may show evidence of special pemphigus autoantibodies (immune proteins active against one’s own tissues). Screening for the most common associated cancers should be performed including imaging such as MRI of chest, abdomen and pelvis.  Pulmonary function tests should be performed to exclude respiratory complications and regular swabs taken to exclude super infection such as herpes simplex. How is paraneoplastic pemphigus treated? Paraneoplastic pemphigus is generally difficult to treat and requires a multi-disciplinary approach. General measures include good oral hygiene, pain control, chlorhexidine mouthwash, lubricants for eyes and nose.  Pureed and soft foods may be required as affected individuals are often unable to eat and swallow normally. Intensive supportive nursing care is required including regular observation monitoring, barrier nursing (strict procedures to avoid transmitting infection from carers and visitors), non-stick dressings and intravenous fluids. Specific treatment is aimed at suppressing the blistering disorder using immunosuppressive agents that may include oral steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis and rituximab. In addition, the underlying cancer needs management with combinations of surgery and chemotherapy. If the underlying cancer is not apparent at the time of diagnosis, regular review is required. Many medical, nursing and paramedical experts are required to look after those affected. Severe infections and respiratory problems are frequent and other organ systems may also be involved further complicating the management of the condition. What is the prognosis in paraneoplastic pemphigus? Paraneoplastic pemphigus has a very high mortality rate (75-90%) due to septicaemia, multi-organ failure, respiratory failure (including bronchiolitis obliterans and obstructive lung disease), gastrointestinal bleeding, the cancer itself or complications of the cancer therapies at the same time as immunosuppression.  Typically those affected with paraneoplastic pemphigus succumb from disease 1 month to 2 years post diagnosis.

        "Erythema Infectiosum": "Also known as…Parvovirus B19 Infection, Fifth Disease or “Slapped Cheek” Disease What is Erythema Infectiosum? Erythema Infectiosum is usually a harmless childhood viral infection characterised by a classic slapped-cheek appearance or a lacy patterned rash. The infection can be associated with fevers. Human parvovirus B19 is a member of the family Parvoviridae. The time from contact to clinical signs and symptoms varies between 4 and 14 days. Transmission is via respiratory secretions, blood products and from a pregnant woman to her foetus. Approximately 75% of cases occur in children aged 5 to15 years but any age group can be affected. Worldwide epidemics of the infection tend to occur in late winter or early spring. One infection gives lifelong immunity. The infection is so common that more than 50% of all adults have been infected by the age of 20. Up to half of those who contract the condition have no signs or symptoms. Mild symptoms such as low-grade fever, muscle aches and headache may occur 7 to10 days before the characteristic rash appears. Rose-red spots on the cheeks rapidly come together to form a hot, red, sunburn-like or “slapped-cheek” appearance. Usually, the rash does not affect the areas around the nose, eyes and mouth. A red bumpy rash may occur 1 to 4 days later on the extremities and to a lesser extent on the trunk. This progresses to a lacy, reticulated pattern. Sometimes spots may appear in the mouth. The rash typically lasts between 1 and 3 weeks. It may recur with exercise, irritation, stress or the skin overheating from sun exposure or bathing in hot water. In adults, especially women, polyarthralgia (multiple inflamed joints) is often the main symptom of infection. Small joints of the hands as well as wrists, knees and ankles are most commonly affected. Joint pain may be present without an accompanying rash. Acute cases are associated with a distinctive syndrome called “papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome”. This is characterised by swelling and redness of palms and soles in association with pinpoint purple spots. Erythema Infectiosum can cause a much more serious infection and trigger a range of complications in high-risk groups: Other conditions associated with or triggered by the condition include: The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical appearance of the rash alone. Blood tests may be needed in cases of doubt or when a pregnant woman has been exposed to the infection. The classic childhood form of the condition is self-limiting which means that it resolves spontaneously without complications. There is no specific treatment. Affected children may remain at school as the infectious stage occurs before the rash is evident. Often the only intervention needed is to reassure parents of affected children. It is important that everyone in the same household washes their hands frequently to reduce the chances of the infection spreading. Symptoms can be relieved by: Pregnant women who may have come into contact with people in the incubation stage or in aplastic crisis should be referred for obstetric follow-up care for possible serologic testing and close foetal monitoring. Individuals predisposed to aplastic crisis require hospitalisation and are likely to need transfusion and/or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. There is no vaccination to prevent the infection.

        "Pediculosis": "Also known as lice What is pediculosis? Pediculosis is the medical term for an infection or infestation with lice which are blood feeding parasites. What causes pediculosis? Lice do not jump or fly from person to person but require direct contact for transfer. They cannot be transmitted via animals. They can be transferred by some objects and clothing such as hats, combs and sheets. The three lice species that infest humans are: How does it present? Intense itch is the usual symptom but the degree of itch does vary among individuals. With the first infestation, it may take 2 to 6 weeks before itching starts. In repeat infestations, itching develops within the first 24 to 48 hours. In some people, infestations do not produce symptoms. Body lice: The body louse causes night time itch, particularly in the underarms, trunk and groin regions (i.e. areas most often covered by clothing). Nits are rarely found on the individual’s skin as the louse lives primarily on the clothing.\nBites present as tiny red lumps with a red base. Crusts and scratches are occasionally complicated by bacterial infections and lymph node enlargement.\n\n\nPubic lice: The lice are most often found within the pubic hair. However, they can spread to other hairy parts of the body. Eyelashes or eyebrows can also be infested.\nBlood specks on underclothes and live lice may be seen moving in the pubic hair. Tiny bleeding spots or bite marks, scratches, secondary bacterial infection and enlarged lymph glands may be present. When the eyelashes are affected, dark flecks can form that look like mascara. Blue spots may be visible at feeding sites.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\nDiagnosis of infestation requires identification of a live louse and/or a viable nit under the microscope. It is easier to identify and remove live lice by wet combing using a lice comb.\nWhat other problems can occur with pediculosis?\n\nItching commonly leads to excoriations (scratch marks) and secondary bacterial infection.\nUpon diagnosis of pubic lice a screen for other STDs should be done\nIn some countries the body louse transmits diseases such as epidemic typhus, trench fever and louse-borne relapsing fever.\n\nHow is pediculosis treated?\nGeneral considerations and prevention\n\nAll people infested with lice in a household and their infested close contacts and bedmates should be treated at the same time.\nItems used by the infested person must be machine washed with hot water and tumble dried.\nItems that cannot be laundered can be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for 2 weeks.\nThe floors and furniture should be vacuumed. However, the risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a rug, carpet or furniture is very small.\nChildren should be taught not to share combs, brushes, hair accessories and towels.\nSoak combs and brushes in hot water (at least 60°C) for 5 to10 minutes.\nDead nits may continue to adhere to hairs and this does not imply treatment failure.\nNits can be removed with a comb designed specifically for that purpose. Use of a hair conditioner makes wet-combing easier. It is best done after treating with anti-lice insecticides. Repeat the combing at least twice more on consecutive nights if possible and then at least weekly until no lice are found on 3 consecutive occasions.\nWhen head lice are detected, notify the child’s school of the infestation. It is not necessary to exclude children from school after the initial treatment of head lice.\nIndividuals with pubic louse infestation should be advised to avoid close body contact until they and their current sexual partner(s) have completed treatment and follow-up.\nShaving pubic hair is beneficial as well as applying topical treatment to all hairy parts of the body apart from the eyelids and scalp. Any remaining nits should be removed by using a fine toothed comb.\nUse of a topical treatment is usually unnecessary with body louse infestation because the lice live on clothing. Treatment of clothing, bed linens and education about hygiene is most important.\n\nTopical agents\n\nIt is important to read the instructions before applying the treatment to ensure that the medication has been left on for the appropriate amount of time and washed off properly.\nNot all eggs are killed with one application of topical medicine, therefore a second application is recommended 7 to10 days later (the time needed for the eggs to hatch).\nVarious topical pediculicidal agents are available: Pyrethrum shampoos and permethrin 1% are available over the counter; permethrin 5%, malathion 0.5% (Ovide®), lindane, topical ivermectin (Sklice®), and spinosad are prescription agents.\nOcclusive products offer an alternative to pediculicides and include:  benzyl alcohol lotion 5%, and 4% dimethicone lotion.\nOther occlusive treatments include vinegar, mayonnaise, petroleum jelly, olive oil, butter, etc. However, most of these have not been scientifically evaluated.\nThe same pediculicides used for head louse infestation are also used for pubic and body louse infestation\nEyelash infestation can be treated effectively with ophthalmic-grade petrolatum.\n\nOral agents\nIvermectin is an option for individuals whose disease is resistant to topical therapies.\nWhat happens when head lice treatment fails?\nFailure to eradicate lice is a common and frustrating problem. There may be a number of reasons for this:\n\nRe-infestation from another person or from contaminated clothes, hats, etc.\nResistance of lice to insecticides or improperly applied treatment. If a course of one kind of insecticide treatment fails, a different insecticide may be selected for the next course.\nIncorrect diagnosis of inactive infection.

        "What are aphthous ulcers?": "Aphthous ulcers are common ulcers of the oral mucosa, and present as a painful sore on oral or genital mucous membranes. They can be classified as simple, complex or non-sexually acquired genital ulceration (NSGU). ",
        "Who gets aphthous ulcers?": "Aphthous ulcers are common. They affect between 5% and 25% of the Australian population, and are more common in adolescents and men. 1 Individuals living in high socioeconomic areas are more likely to develop aphthous ulcers. ",
        "What causes aphthous ulcers?": "The exact cause of aphthous ulcers is unknown. Approximately 40% of individuals who get aphthous ulcers have a family history of aphthous ulcers. 2 A weakened immune may also play a role in the development of aphthous ulcers. Some other factors that trigger an outbreak of aphthous ulcers may include: ",
        "What do aphthous ulcers look like?": "Aphthous ulcers are often round, shallow and painful with a creamy-white or grey film and red halo. They occur predominantly in the skin inside the mouth but can also occur in the genital areas. Individuals may experience a single or multiple ulcers. Aphthous ulcers are classified into three categories: ",
        "How are aphthous ulcers diagnosed?": "Aphthous ulcers are usually diagnosed clinically. Complex aphthous ulcers may require blood tests including: A biopsy is rarely required, but is necessary if the ulcer does not heal within 3 to 4 weeks. A swab of the ulcer is also essential to evaluate the presence of a viral, bacterial or candida infection. ",
        "How are aphthous ulcers treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Most recurrent minor aphthous ulcers heal without treatment in a couple of weeks. The aim of treatment is to: Some general measures, include: Topical prescription medicines are rarely needed, but may include corticosteroids and analgesics. In severe cases, oral medications may be used, such as: Biologic agents such as adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab have also been reported to help as well as the oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor apremilast in severe resistant cases. The use of laser, such as CO2 and Nd:YAG may also improve symptoms. ",

        "Perioral dermatitis": "Also known as periorificial dermatitis, steroid induced rosacea, “muzzle rash” What is it? Perioral dermatitis is a common inflammatory rash that occurs around the mouth area. Other affected areas include around the nose, chin and eyes. Perioral dermatitis affects women more than men and is frequently associated with topical steroid medication usage. Fortunately, perioral dermatitis is responsive to treatment and recurrence is rare. What causes perioral dermatitis? The cause of perioral dermatitis is unknown however several factors may play a role in the development of this condition, including: What does perioral dermatitis look like? Perioral dermatitis presents as multiple red pimple-like bumps that tend to group around the mouth, nose and chin.  The skin around the eyes is occasionally affected. If the lip area is affected, the lip line is classically spared. The overlying skin may be red, dry and flaky. This condition is more common in women than men. Children can also be affected. Perioral dermatitis may be symptomless however burning, tightness and itchiness are common. Perioral dermatitis frequently starts off from an unrelated rash or skin irritation. Topical creams, most often corticosteroid and over the counter preparations, are then used. This leads to an outbreak of perioral dermatitis which then seems to be less red with further steroid usage. Ceasing topical steroids generally leads to a flare-up which then encourages further steroid use. Hence a vicious cycle of steroid use is set up. How is it diagnosed? No tests are usually necessary.  Most cases of perioral dermatitis can be diagnosed from a history and examination. In resistant cases, allergic contact dermatitis should be considered and investigated through targeted patch testing. Consider specialist referral. How is it treated? If steroid cream use is suspected, stop using the cream altogether. A rebound or flare-up of perioral dermatitis is to be expected after you stop using the cream, however do not be tempted to re-use the steroid cream again.  If steroid nasal sprays or inhalers are suspected, try rinsing the face and mouth after use. Simplify all skin care. Use soap substitutes and gentle skin care products. If possible, keep make-up use to a minimum. Oral antibiotics are the most effective treatment. They are effective through anti-inflammatory mechanisms and not through their anti-microbial actions.  Usually a 6 week course is prescribed. An additional 6 week course may be considered if the rash recurs. Tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics are most frequently used, including doxycycline, minocycline and erythromycin (the only option in children whose teeth have not formed). Topical medications are not as effective as oral medications.  Examples include erythromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole and azelaic acid.  These may be preferred in pregnancy. Topical pimecrolimus has also been used however this medication has occasionally been reported to be the trigger for perioral dermatitis and should be used with caution. Erythromycin suspension for 4 to 8 weeks is recommended in the treatment of children under the age of 8. What is the likely outcome of perioral dermatitis? Perioral dermatitis carries an excellent prognosis and recurrences are rare providing initiating factors are avoided. Most individuals will start to improve within a few weeks of treatment. If perioral dermatitis recurs, a further 6 week course of antibiotics is recommended. The use of a simplified skin care regime, coupled with avoidance of topical corticosteroids and heavy make-up can prevent recurrences. Consider referral to a dermatologist for resistant cases. Prevention, by avoiding strong topical corticosteroids on the face, is the best option. This information has been written by Dr Davin S.

The condition presents with redness and irritation. Angular cheilitis is more common in the elderly due to the occlusion from an overhanging upper lip. This causes pronounced skin folds and leads to constant moistening and subsequent irritation from saliva. Other causes can include a receding jawline and poorly fitting dentures that can lead to secondary bacterial and candida infection. Other causes include: Affected individuals have painful cracks or fissures, redness, moisture and occlusion at corners of the mouth. The condition can be chronic and recurrent especially in the elderly. Angular cheilitis is sometimes difficult to treat and treatment and may need to be prolonged.

        "Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP)": "Also known as … Chronic Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis, Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris, persistent palmoplantar pustulosisWhat is palmoplantar pustulosis? Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic pustular condition affecting the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet. It may occur with psoriasis or without any other skin disease. The cause of PPP is not completely understood. PPP affects the eccrine sweat glands which are most common on the palms and soles. It may be autoimmune in origin. Genetic factors are important as several members of some families may be affected. PPP presents as crops of itchy or sore pustules on the palms and/or soles. PPP can occur on one or both hands and/or feet. Scaly red patches may also be seen in association with the pustules. In the more chronic stages of the disease, the skin can be dry and thickened with deep fissures (cracks in the skin). There is usually a sharp demarcation between the normal and affected skin areas. PPP varies in severity and may persist for many years. The discomfort can be considerable, interfering with work and affecting quality of life. A form of PPP which affects the tips of the fingers is called acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau or acropustulosis. It can lead to destruction of the fingernail on affected digits. Certain conditions have been reported to occur in individuals with PPP: In most cases, the diagnosis is made by clinical examination. In rare cases, a biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Skin scrapings can exclude fungal infections that may mimic PPP.  Skin swabs may be taken to exclude a bacterial infection but will be negative in uncomplicated PPP. Treatment of PPP can be difficult. The condition can also respond poorly to therapy. Less severe cases can usually be managed with topical treatments. More severe cases may require physical or systemic therapy. General measures Topical treatments Light treatment Systemic treatment Systemic treatments include tablets or injections that require regular monitoring.

        "What is phototherapy?": "Phototherapy uses different wavelengths of ultraviolet (UV) light on the surface and in deeper layers of the skin. Phototherapy can treat widespread skin diseases, as well as conditions that cause loss of colour. ",
        "When is phototherapy used?": "Phototherapy is commonly used to treat widespread skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) and psoriasis that cause inflammation (redness, scaling, itching, tenderness and swelling). It may be used to treat vitiligo, but it may take longer for the skin to respond to the treatment and recovery may only be partial. Phototherapy may also be used to treat less common conditions, such as lichen planus, granuloma annulare and mycosis fungoides. ",
        "What types of ultraviolet treatments are there?": "Ultraviolet B (UVB) Ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy delivers shortwave UV to treat skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema by controlling DNA synthesis. This reduces inflammation. Narrowband UVB (NBUVB) phototherapy is used more than broadband UVB phototherapy. Exposure and treatment times are shorter for NBUVB and result in longer periods of remission. Psoralen + UVA (PUVA) Psoralen + UVA (PUVA) is another type of phototherapy treatment used for severe skin diseases. PUVA is a combination treatment which involves psoralen medication and exposing the skin to a longer wavelength of ultraviolet light which can penetrate more deeply into the skin. ",
        "What will I have to do if phototherapy is prescribed for me?": "Individuals should advise their dermatologist about any medications that are being taken when phototherapy is first prescribed. Before phototherapy treatment, the dermatologist will provide protective eyewear to cover the eyes. In some cases, individuals may be given additional protective equipment, such as a facemask, depending on the location of the treatment. Individuals will need to stand still inside the phototherapy cabinet which has fluorescent tubes that produce ultraviolet rays on the walls. Each treatment session will last from several seconds to several minutes. The treatment can be stopped at any stage by opening the door of the cabinet and stepping out. The dermatologist will determine the dosage by testing the response of a small area of non-sun-exposed skin to a series of ultraviolet doses, or by evaluating the individuals skin type (fair, olive, dark, very dark). A protocol is then developed and followed based on this assessment. Treatment usually occurs three times per week (evenly spaced throughout the week) for up to 10 weeks. However, this may be adjusted by the dermatologist. It is important individuals attend appointments regularly to achieve the best possible outcome. Figure 1. Phototherapy Full Body Cabin ",
        "When is phototherapy not used?": "Phototherapy may not be recommended for individuals who: ",
        "What problems can occur with phototherapy?": "There are potential risks that can occur with phototherapy, including: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of phototherapy?": "Phototherapy treatment will usually be continued until the skin condition has cleared or is stable. In some cases, the frequency of treatments may be reduced rather than stopped. Any ongoing treatment and management should be under the supervision of the individual’s dermatologist.

        "Who gets melasma?": "Melasma is more commonly seen in females. It usually gets worse in summer months. ",
        "What causes melasma?": "The cause of melasma is unknown but many different factors may play a role. These include genetics, sun exposure and hormonal changes (e.g. using the oral contraceptive pill, pregnancy). Ultraviolet radiation stimulates melanocytes (pigment producing cells) to produce more melanin (dark pigment). Evidence suggests that blood vessel abnormalities within the patches of melasma can also contribute to excessive pigmentation. 1 ",
        "What does melasma look like?": "Melasma appears as patchy areas of light brown, tan or even dark brown pigmentation. The excessive melanin may be located in the superficial layers of the skin (epidermal melasma), the deeper layers of the skin (deep melasma) or in both layers of the skin (mixed melasma). The areas of skin most commonly affected are the forehead, cheeks and upper lip. In rare cases, melasma can affect the forearms. Figure 1.

Melasma on forehead – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Davin Lim. ",
        "How is melasma diagnosed?": "Melasma is usually diagnosed after examining the colour and distribution of the pigment on the face. A handheld dermatoscope (polarized magnifying instrument) may be used to assist diagnosis. A small sample of the skin (biopsy) may be taken to further confirm the diagnosis and exclude other causes of increased pigmentation. ",
        "How is melasma treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. General measures, such as sun protection is essential with a SPF50 or SPF50+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant and ideally iron oxide containing sunscreen. Sunscreens should be applied twice a day, 20 minutes prior to sun exposure. Broad brimmed hats should be worn when outdoors. If hormonal factors are implicated, the use of the oral contraceptive pill or intrauterine devices should be discontinued if feasible. Treatment options may include: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of melasma?": "Epidermal melasma has a better prognosis than mixed or dermal melasma but all types are recurrent and require ongoing treatment. Often melasma will achieve improvement but not complete clearance. Melasma associated with pregnancy is likely to improve, with pigment gradually fading over months. However, melasma often recurs in subsequent pregnancies. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Pigmented Purpuric Dermatosis": "Also known as … Capillaritis Pigmented Purpuric Dermatosis is an uncommon condition that affects all races and ages. It usually manifests as small or large patches of cayenne pepper coloured spots and pigmentation. The skin rash is usually found on the lower limbs but may also involve the trunk.  The cause of pigmented purpuric dermatosis is currently unknown. Several risk factors have been implicated including venous disease, capillary fragility, certain drugs and allergy to certain food colourings and dyes. Basic science and clinical research is currently underway to investigate the cause of this condition and explore effective treatments. There are several different forms of pigmented purpuric dermatosis but all these forms share some common features. The key feature is the cayenne pepper coloured spots that can join up to create larger patches. The cayenne pepper spots indicate fresh lesions. The spots are fixed and do not disappear with pressure. Spots or larger patches of brown pigmentation indicate older lesions. Except for one form PPD is usually not itchy and not painful. The diagnosis is usually made by the dermatologist examining the individual. A skin biopsy will confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of pigmented purpuric dermatosis depends on the underlying condition. Treatment of the underlying venous disease will improve the rash but will not result in complete resolution. Any medication that is found to be the cause should be stopped. Specialised blood tests and even allergy testing may be required to find the cause.

        "What does acne vulgaris look like?": "Acne mostly occurs on the face, chest, and trunk. Many different types of acne spots can occur, often at the same time. Whiteheads are small, often tiny, non-inflamed spots under the skin surface while blackheads appear as an open pore with a black plug. Whiteheads and blackheads are usually the first lesions that develop and may, but not always, be followed by the development of red lumps and pustules. If the acne becomes more inflamed, larger, redder, deeper and more tender nodules or cysts may develop. These very inflamed lesions often lead to scarring. Some drug reactions may result in many small pustules developing on the face and trunk. These reactions are sometimes described as “acneiform drug eruptions”. These can be distinguished from acne because of the absence of comedones (blackheads or whiteheads). Figure 1. Whiteheads – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Jo-Ann See Figure 2.

        "Pityriasis Alba": "What is it? Pityriasis alba is a benign and very common, self-resolving, eczematous (mild dermatitis) rash that most commonly affects children and young adults. It is more noticeable in people with skin of colour (pigmented skin). What causes it? The cause of pityriasis alba is unknown. Pityriasis alba is not caused by a fungus and is not contagious. What does it look like? Pityriasis alba looks like multiple, discrete, poorly outlined hypopigmented (whitish) or pinkish spots and patches. The spots are usually dry, with or without the presence of scale. These patches are seen most commonly on the face, neck and upper limbs. Pityriasis alba may be itchy but more commonly there are no symptoms associated with the condition. The condition tends to be more common in dry winter months, however the patches may be more noticeable in summer when the surrounding skin is tanned and the colour difference between the whitish patches and the tanned skin is more obvious. What other problems can occur with this condition? This condition may be associated with atopic (allergic) conditions such as eczema, asthma or hayfever. How is it diagnosed? No formal tests are required to make the diagnosis. It is diagnosed by clinical examination of the skin (looking at the skin). How is it treated? Treatment for this condition is not usually necessary. Moisturising creams may help with skin dryness and the general appearance of the condition. A mild steroid cream or non-steroid cream such as pimecrolimus may be prescribed for a short time if mild inflammation is present. What is the prognosis/likely outcome of it? The pigment changes (white areas) in the skin usually take several months to recover. Pityriasis alba resolves spontaneously and may take several months or years to recover. This condition does not cause any long-term complications or scarring. This information has been written by Dr Michelle Rodrigues Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

It is more common in warm humid environments and may be seasonal. Most people with this condition are concerned about the appearance of the rash. Sometimes it may cause minor symptoms such as scaling, itch or irritation. It can be much more widespread if there is a problem with the immune system. What causes pityriasis versicolor? Pityriasis versicolor is a skin reaction to overgrowth of normally occurring yeast organisms (Malassezia genus, formerly known as Pityrosporum) living on the skin. About 90% of healthy people have these yeast organisms growing on their skin but they grow in larger numbers with sweating and humidity and where the sebaceous (oil) glands in the skin are very active.  Some people may have an inherited predisposition to overgrowth of these organisms. The yeast produces chemicals which may affect the normal pigment production in the skin. What does pityriasis versicolor look like? The typical appearance of the rash is of a discoloured round or oval shaped eruption most commonly on the upper trunk region, sometimes extending to the neck or upper limbs.  Occasionally, the rash may affect other areas of the body. The colour of the eruption may appear lighter or darker than the surrounding normal skin, hence the name “versicolor”. The rash itself may be slightly raised with a fine scale. How is pityriasis versicolor diagnosed? The diagnosis of pityriasis versicolour is based on a clinical examination and the typical appearance of the eruption. The affected skin may show yellowish fluorescence under long wave ultraviolet light (Wood’s lamp) examination. Samples may be taken from the fine scaly skin of the eruption to check for the typical yeast organisms. In rare cases, a skin biopsy taken under local anaesthetic may be required for examination under a microscope. How is pityriasis versicolor treated? Treatment may be required if the rash is causing concern. Treatment is directed towards reducing the number of yeast organisms living in the skin of the affected areas, using an anti-fungal preparation applied directly to the skin. Examples include imidazole lotions or creams (such as ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole) and anti-dandruff shampoos (such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, selenium sulphide, ciclopirox olamine). For smaller areas, one of the imidazole creams or lotions may be suitable and may be applied once or twice daily for 1 to 4 weeks. For larger areas, one of the above anti-dandruff shampoos may be used as a body wash. The shampoo is applied to the whole affected area (after wetting the skin) and left on for 5 to 10 minutes before washing off. This is to allow time for the active ingredient to penetrate into the skin and hair follicles to reduce the number of yeast organisms. The treatment is performed daily for 1 to 4 weeks and subsequent maintenance therapy once or twice a week may be required to prevent recurrence. The effectiveness is generally improved with a longer course of treatment and a higher concentration of the active ingredient. If skin irritation occurs, treatment should be stopped and medical advice obtained. Oral anti-fungal treatment may be considered in unusually severe or resistant cases but there is a risk of side effects and drug interactions occuring with these oral medications. Your doctor will discuss these issues. The discolouration of the skin may take some months to return to normal, even after successful treatment.

        "Plantar hyperhidrosis": "Also known as sweaty feet What is plantar hyperhidrosis? Plantar hyperhidrosis is a common condition affecting 1-3% of the population. The condition usually starts in childhood or adolescence.  It can cause significant physical limitations and predispose to bacterial and fungal infections and friction blisters. What causes plantar hyperhidrosis? Many factors can contribute to plantar hyperhidrosis including genetic influences, as well as physical and emotional stress. A family history is present in up to 30% of cases. What does plantar hyperhidrosis look like? Plantar hyperhidrosis affects both feet equally. The condition can range from mild sweating through to severe constant sweating, but which stops when asleep. What other problems can occur with palmar hyperhidrosis? Plantar hyperhidrosis can occur on its own or in combination with other conditions. Severe cases can lead to infections such as tinea pedis, pitted keratolysis and other bacterial infections. The condition can be very distressing due to its impact on quality of life. Plantar hyperhidrosis can also be associated with increased sweating in other parts of the body including underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis), face and scalp (craniofacial hyperhidrosis). How is plantar hyperhidrosis diagnosed? Most cases are not associated with an underlying illness. The diagnosis is usually made based on a history of excessive sweating. No investigations are needed. When there is evidence of tinea or bacterial infection a skin scraping and bacterial swab may be needed. Depending on the results, an anti-fungal or antibiotic cream or tablet may be recommended. Further investigations are considered when excessive sweating affects larger areas of the body or if hyperhidrosis occurs during sleep. How is plantar hyperhidrosis treated? The use of absorbent inner soles (summer soles) can help preserve your shoes. Double layered white cotton socks can help soak up excessive sweating. Changing socks frequently can help reduce the incidence of infections. The use of talc and powders can also help absorb excessive sweating. Shoe driers can help increase the lifespan of your shoes. Mild cases of plantar hyperhidrosis can respond to topical treatments such as aluminium chloride hexahydrate (Driclor). Driclor should always be applied to skin that is as dry as possible in order to maximise the benefit and minimise potential side effects. Ideally, it should be applied just after a shower prior to bedtime. Dry the area off with a hairdryer on the cool setting then apply Driclor. Rinse your feet first thing in the morning with plain water (no soap). If irritation develops, applying a corticosteroid cream on alternate days can be useful (this needs to used be under the guidance of a health professional). Anticholinergic creams such as glycopyrolate (0.5-3%) may be effective in managing plantar hyperhidrosis. A compounding pharmacist can make up these creams. The skin will absorb more cream if a foot scrub is used first. Iontophoresis may be considered for cases which do not respond to topical treatments. Treatments are individualised. The affected area is immersed in tap water, salty water or glycopyrrolate solution. Then a gentle electric current is passed across the skin surface for 10 to 20 minutes. Glycopyrrolate iontophoresis has the highest success rate – up to 80% of affected people respond well to this treatment. The time between treatments will vary. Treatments will need to be repeated every 2 to14 days. Botox injections can treat sweaty feet safely and effectively. However, the treatment is not subsidised under Medicare-PBS and the cost limits its wider use. Botox treatment is usually performed under a nerve block. The amount of botox needed depends on the size of the feet. Usually 130 to 200 units of botox are needed in each foot. The treatment is usually effective for 3 to 4 months. Side effects include temporary muscle weakness. Anticholinergic tablets (such as oxybutynin and propantheline bromide) can be useful for plantar hyperhidrosos. However, side effects such as blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth and excessive drowsiness are common. Other medications reported to be useful include oral glycopyrrolate (not available in Australia), propranolol, clonazepam and gabapentin. Medication can be a viable short-term option for treating sweaty feet for several days to weeks and give people a “break” from their sweating. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy is not a treatment option for plantar hyperhidrosis. What is the likely outcome of plantar hyperhidrosis? Plantar hyperhidrosis will often need ongoing and persistent treatment. However, some people may notice the amount of sweating decreases as they get older.

        "What is cutaneous larva migrans?": "Cutaneous larva migrans is an itchy localised skin infestation caused by the penetration and migration of animal hookworm larvae through the skin. ",
        "Who gets cutaneous larva migrans?": "Individuals of all ages, sex and race can be affected by cutaneous larva migrans if they have been exposed to hookworm larvae. The condition is more common in tropical or subtropical regions such as the northern parts of Australia and tropical Asian countries. Individuals who come into contact with warm, moist, sandy soil infested with animal faeces are most at risk of developing this condition, and may include: ",
        "What causes cutaneous larva migrans?": "The condition is caused by the larvae of hookworms that infect dogs, cats and other animals. The infection of a human host usually occurs as a result of lying, sitting or walking barefoot on ground contaminated with animal faeces. The condition remains confined to the outer layers of the skin as the larvae are unable to penetrate the basement membrane to invade the deeper layers. ",
        "What does cutaneous larva migrans look like?": "Affected individuals may have intense localised itch that begins shortly after the hookworm penetrates the skin. Red, swollen lumps, fluid-filled lumps and/or one or more snake-like tracts appear as the condition progresses. Hundreds of such lesions may be found on a single individual. Non-specific dermatitis, blistering lesions and superimposed bacterial infection may make larva migrans more difficult to diagnose. The condition most frequently affects the lower extremities, abdomen or buttocks but any exposed site may be affected. Figure 1. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

        "How is cutaneous larva migrans diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually based on a clinical examination of the skin. Skin biopsies are sometimes needed. ",
        "How is cutaneous larva migrans treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Prevention is key, including: Even though the condition is self-limiting, treatment is available to shorten its course and to alleviate symptoms, and may include: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of cutaneous larva migrans?": "The condition is self-limiting which means that it resolves spontaneously without treatment. The time taken to resolve varies considerably depending on the species of larvae involved. In most cases, lesions will resolve without treatment within 4 to 8 weeks, but some may persist for many months.

        "Poikiloderma of Civatte": "What is poikiloderma of civatte? Poikiloderma of civatte was first described in 1923 and refers to redness and mottled pigment on the sides of the neck. The area under the chin is usually unaffected. This condition is more commonly seen in women and in areas of high UV exposure. What causes poikiloderma of civatte? The cause of poikiloderma of civatte is unknown. However fair skin, sun exposure, hormonal factors and some components of cosmetics and toiletries (photosensitising components) are all thought to play a part in the development of the condition. What does poikiloderma of civatte look like? Skin thinning (atrophy), redness from enlarged blood vessels (erythema) and colour (pigmentary) changes are seen in sun-exposed skin. Poikiloderma of civatte most commonly affects the sides of the neck whilst the area under the neck remains characteristically unaffected. Poikiloderma of civatte may also affect other areas on the face. What other problems can occur with poikiloderma of civatte? There are no known medical problems associated with the condition. Similar changes on the neck may be seen in genetic skin conditions such as Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, Bloom syndrome and connective tissue diseases (such as dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus and mycosis fungoides). Similar changes may also be seen in skin that has been treated previously with radiotherapy. How is poikiloderma of civatte diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made by looking at and assessing the skin.  No formal tests are required. In some cases a skin biopsy and/or blood tests are needed to exclude other conditions which have a similar appearance. How is poikiloderma of civatte treated? Treating poikiloderma of civatte can be difficult. Your dermatologist will frequently combine some of the techniques below to achieve the best possible outcome. What is the prognosis/likely outcome of poikiloderma of civatte? If left untreated, poikiloderma of civatte may improve marginally with the use of sun protection (photoprotection). With diligent sun avoidance and active sun protection, the brown areas may fade, however the red areas will be unchanged. Following treatment, the skin will need to be protected diligently from any sun exposure to decrease the risk of poikiloderma of civatte recurring. Maintenance laser treatments may be used intermittently if the condition recurs. This information has been written by Dr Davin S.

        "What is polyarteritis nodosa?": "Polyarteritis nodosa occurs (PAN) is a rare condition affecting the medium-sized blood vessels of the body. When the medium-sized blood vessels in your body becomes inflamed, we call this “medium-vessel vasculitis”, which includes PAN. There are two variants of PAN:\n• Cutaneous PAN (10% of cases) – only affects the skin, and typically follows a benign yet chronic course. Progression to systemic PAN would be very rare.\n• Systemic PAN (90% of cases) – affect multiple organs, with or without skin involvement, and can lead to potentially serious complications. PAN occurs most frequently in patients between 40 to 60 years of age. It affects males and females equally and has no racial predilection. ",
        "What causes polyarteritis nodosa?": "PAN is caused by a complex mixture of immunological factors. PAN may be triggered by infections, in particular hepatitis B virus. Other infections that may cause PAN include hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), coxsackie B4 virus, streptococcus and mycobacterium fortuitum. Certain drugs (such as minocycline), malignancies (especially hairy cell leukaemia), and systemic disorders (such as lupus and inflammatory bowel disease) are also associated with PAN. Lastly, certain genetic factors can make an individual more prone to getting PAN. ",
        "What does polyarteritis nodosa look like?": "On the skin, there may be deep nodules most commonly located on the lower legs or near the ankles, followed by the thighs, buttocks, arms or hands. The nodules may be painful and may ulcerate. There may also be radiating star-shaped purple bruises (retiform purpura) or lace-like reticulated rashes (livedo racemosa). Low blood supply to the fingertips causing tissue death can occur as well. ",
        "What other problems can occur with polyarteritis nodosa?": "Both cutaneous PAN and systemic PAN may present with generalised symptoms such as weight loss, tiredness, myalgias, joint pains, fevers and nerve numbness.  In systemic PAN, other organs may be involved, leading to: ",
        "How is polyarteritis nodosa diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made by a specialised medical doctor such as a dermatologist or immunologist. When there’s skin lesions, a deep incisional skin biopsy is crucial in making the diagnosis of PAN. The sample will be examined under the microscope, which would likely show inflammation of the medium vessels. Blood tests and imaging needs to be ordered to rule out other types of medium vessel vasculitis, to look for the underlying cause of the PAN such as infections and to plan treatment. ",
        "How is polyarteritis nodosa treated?": "When PAN is associated with an underlying cause, the underlying cause should be addressed e.g. HBV treated and minocycline stopped. Cutaneous PAN\nAs cutaneous PAN follows a favourable prognosis, treatment for it is not as aggressive as treatment for systemic PAN. In mild or localised cutaneous PAN, topical or intralesional corticosteroids may be enough. However, progressive or extensive disease may warrant systemic corticosteroids. Second-line treatments for cutaneous PAN include methotrexate, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azathioprine, mycophenolate and IVIg. Systemic PAN\nFirst-line treatment for systemic PAN is high dose systemic corticosteroids tapered over 3-6 months. Second-line treatment for systemic PAN include cyclophosphamide, Rituximab, plasmaphoresis and IVIg. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of polyarteritis nodosa?": "Cutaneous PAN is considered to have a favourable prognosis, despite that it may be potentially chronic. Systemic PAN associated with gastrointestinal track, renal heart and brain involvement are associated with higher mortality.

        "Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy": "Also known as pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) What is polymorphic eruption of pregnancy? Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP) is a relatively common pregnancy dermatosis that causes very itchy red bumps to appear over the abdomen. The condition develops late in pregnancy and usually resolves soon after birth. This condition does not cause any harm to the baby. What causes PEP? The cause of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy is unknown. This condition is more common in first pregnancies and has been associated with large babies, twins and increased weight gain during pregnancy. One popular theory is that PEP may be related to the stretching of the skin during pregnancy. What does PEP look like? Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy usually starts in the 3rd trimester (average onset around 36 to 39 weeks of pregnancy). Red bumps develop on the abdomen, often involving stretch marks (striae) but sparing the belly button (umbilicus). The rash may spread to the buttocks, legs and arms. PEP is usually very itchy. Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy What other problems can occur with PEP? There are no known associated diseases. Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy does not adversely affect the pregnancy or cause any harm to the baby. How is PEP diagnosed? A skin biopsy may be performed to exclude other conditions such as pemphigoid gestationis. How is PEP treated? Steroid ointments are the treatment of choice for PEP. They do not cure the condition but relieve itching and redness. Steroid tablets may be required in rare cases. Keeping cool, generous application of a moisturiser, oatmeal baths, topical compounded menthol and the regular use of antihistamines may all improve comfort. What is the likely outcome of PEP? Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy usually clears within days to weeks after the baby is born, but sometimes lasts 1 month into the postnatal period. This condition does not usually recur in future pregnancies.

        "Polymorphic Light Eruption": "Also known as Polymorphous light eruption What is polymorphic light eruption? Polymorphic light eruption is a sunlight-sensitive rash (photodermatosis) on skin that has been exposed to sunlight. As the name “polymorphic” suggests, the rash can present in many different forms from tiny red pin-head sized spots through to large patches of redness. What causes polymorphic light eruption? Polymorphic light eruption results from exposure to sunlight in those who are predisposed to developing the condition. In Australia, it is more frequently seen in the southern states. Polymorphic light eruption affects more females than males and is more common in fair skinned individuals between the ages of 20 to 40 years. Polymorphic light eruption is usually seasonal. It appears in early spring after the skin has been protected from sunlight over the winter months. The rash appears either rapidly within hours or within days after sun exposure. The amount of sunlight required to trigger the condition is highly variable, ranging from minutes to hours. Both UVB and UVA wavelengths can trigger the rash. What does polymorphic light eruption look like? The rash usually appears on sun-exposed areas of the skin such as the chest, neck, arms and face. The rash can vary in appearance – it may look like multiple raised red spots and dots, or itchy pin-sized lumps, or it can look like hives. The rash may be itchy or cause a burning or stinging sensation. The rash usually fades within 2 to 7 days without leaving a mark. Over time, most sufferers experience a phenomenon known as “skin hardening” which means that the skin develops a tolerance to sunlight after repeated sun exposure. The condition usually improves over the summer months or with further UV exposure (e.g. phototherapy). How is polymorphic light eruption diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist based on the history of events leading up to the rash and the characteristic appearance of the rash. In some cases a blood test, urine sample or stool sample may be needed to exclude other photodermatoses such as lupus erythematosus or erythropoietic protoporphyria. A skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Phototesting may be undertaken in a specialist clinic to confirm the diagnosis. How is polymorphic light eruption treated? Polymorphic light eruption is prevented by appropriate sun protection which includes avoiding the sun, wearing protective clothing and sunglasses, as well as the appropriate use of sunscreens (a SPF50 or SPF50+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen). Supplements such as beta carotene and nicotinamide (vitamin B3) may be helpful in preventing polymorphic light eruption. Medically supervised phototherapy may be prescribed to “harden” the skin if the condition persists or continues to be particularly troublesome. Exposure to natural sunlight in a graduated manner can also “harden” skin, however, this method is not recommended as the risk of developing skin cancer is increased. Sun beds or tanning booths are not medically prescribed equipment and are not safe. Other treatment options include medications such as topical steroid creams, oral prednisolone or prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine and thalidomide. What is the outcome for polymorphic light eruption? Most people with polymorphic light eruption will experience seasonal flare-ups of the condition especially at the beginning of sunnier weather. In Australia, most cases occur at the beginning of spring (September and October). Preventative treatments such as “skin hardening” may be considered several weeks prior to this time of year. For people known to be at risk of developing polymorphic light eruption, medication may be prescribed as a form of prevention, particularly when planning a trip to a sunny location.

        "Pompholyx": "Also known as … Dyshidrotic Eczema or Vesicular Eczema of Palms and Soles What is Pompholyx? Pompholyx is an often recurrent and frequently extremely itchy disorder characterised by tiny blisters and bumps on the sides of fingers, toes, palms and soles. The cause of pompholyx is unknown. Pompholyx is considered a localised reaction pattern seen in other forms of dermatitis such as atopic dermatitis and allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. Pompholyx is characterised by the sudden onset of crops of symmetric, firm, deep-seated tiny blisters on the palms, sides of fingers and less often on the soles and toes. These may aggregate and form larger blisters. Intense itch and/or burning sensation usually precede the eruption. The attack can subside spontaneously over weeks to months. It is often recurrent. In long-standing cases, the individual’s fingernails may discolour or develop ridges.Occasionally a bacterial infection, cellulitis or lymphangitis may develop. Diagnosis of the pompholyx reaction pattern is based on a clinical examination of the hands and feet. A detailed history and wider clinical examination of the skin is needed in order to rule out an associated condition and guide further investigations. The following associated conditions should be considered:• Atopic eczema        o May be a late stage reaction and there may not be many other signs of dermatitis. History of past dermatitis is relevant.• Contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis – nickel, cobalt, chromium and cosmetics have all been associated with a pompholyx reaction. Patch testing may be required.• Irritant contact dermatitis has also been associated with pompholyx.• Infections       o Inflammatory fungal infections may be associated with an id or pompholyx like reaction.       o Examination and investigations for evidence of bacterial or fungal infection may be required.• Stress can be associated with a worsening of the pompholyx.• Pompholyx has been associated with some immune system modifying agents.• Hyperhidrosis of hands and feet may be associated with an increased likelihood of contact dermatitis and fungal infections that may trigger the pompholyx reaction. Pompholyx may be difficult to treat. It is important to treat an associated condition, if present. General advice:• Avoid contact with irritants or allergens• Use bland unscented moisturisers or just plain water, to clean hands• Wear protective gloves in everyday activities• Stop smoking• Apply bland moisturisers frequently Topical therapy:The cornerstone of topical therapy is high-strength cortisone creams that may be appliedwith wet wraps or cling wrap to increase their effectiveness. Other anti-inflammatorycreams such as calcineurin inhibitors can also be effective. Management of bullae or blisters:Blisters can be managed with compresses soaked in a very light pink solution of potassium permanganate or Burrow’s solution (10% aluminium acetate solution diluted to 1:40). Large blisters can be aspirated (pierced with a sterile needle). Oral medications:A short course of oral anti-inflammatory medication such as prednisolone may be required in severe flare-ups of pompholyx. For severe, recalcitrant and chronic cases, corticosteroids may be combined with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin. Antihistamines can be helpful in treating the associated itch in some people. Phototherapy and photochemotherapyVariable effects have been reported using topical PUVA, oral PUVA or narrowband UVB to help control the inflammation.

        "What is porokeratosis?": "Porokeratosis consists of a group of skin lesions characterised by having thin, raised, scaly edge known as the cornoid lamella. Porokeratosis can occur anywhere on the skin. These can be felt and may be seen more clearly under a dermatoscope. There are several different subtypes of porokeratosis – the most common are disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis and disseminated porokeratosis. ",
        "Who gets porokeratosis?": "Depending on the subtype of porokeratosis, it can appear from birth or manifest later in life. Some forms may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, but in many cases, there is no family history. ",
        "What causes porokeratosis?": "The cause of the porokeratoses is unknown. Genetics may play a role, as certain genetic mutations such as phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK) and mevalonate kinase (MVK) have been found in various subtypes. Other potential triggers may include ultraviolet radiation exposure, immunosuppression and organ transplantation. ",
        "What does porokeratosis look like?": "Individual lesions appear as red, scaly areas of skin with a surrounding raised ring of scale at the outer edge. The size, sites and onset of the porokeratoses vary according to the subtype. Figure 1. Porokeratosis of mibelli on the anterior thigh – Image reproduced with permission from Dr Cathy Zhao Figure 2. Plaque of squamous cell carcinoma on left shin, on a background of longstanding DSAP – Image reproduced with permission from Dr Cathy Zhao ",
        "How is porokeratosis diagnosed?": "Porokeratosis is usually diagnosed clinically. Some subtypes of porokeratosis, such as DSAP or Mibelli are diagnosed based on their characteristics. Other subtypes may require a skin biopsy (best performed on the lesions raised edge) to confirm diagnosis. Porokeratoses rarely undergo malignant transformation, however the lesions may need to be differentiated from solar keratoses in the sun exposed areas. ",
        "How is porokeratosis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs, as well as the subtype of porokeratosis. General preventative measures, such as appropriate sun protection measures can prevent the development of further lesions and reduce the risk of porokeratosis developing into skin cancer. Other treatment options may include: ",
        "What is the likely outcome of porokeratosis?": "Although very rare, there have been reports of squamous cell carcinoma developing in all subtypes of porokeratosis. 2 This is more common in linear porokeratosis, in older patients with longstanding lesions and when lesions change from red, scaly rings to raised, nodular lesions.

        "Porphyria cutanea tarda": "What is porphyria cutanea tarda? Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a rare condition which is characterised by blistering and fragility of the skin in sun exposed areas. The breaks in the skin and blisters often heal with scarring and small superficial cysts called milia may form. PCT is the most common type of porphyria. It occurs worldwide. Variegate porphyria has skin changes similar to PCT plus acute neurologic problems. It is mainly seen in South Africa where it is reasonably common and also in Chile. There are other forms of porphyria that may result in cutaneous manifestations and attacks of neurologic symptoms that we are not covering here. What causes it? Heme is the iron-containing compound found in red blood cells used to carry oxygen which is broken down in a series of steps and ultimately excreted in the urine. PCT results from reduced activity of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase in the liver which is involved in the breakdown of heme. If the heme is not broken down in the usual way, porphyrins accumulate in the skin. These compounds absorb UV energy that is released in the skin, creating changes that lead to blistering, fragility and scarring of the skin. There are two types of PCT. What does it look like? Individuals with PCT suffer from photosensitivity which means the skin is damaged by sunlight. The skin changes appear on sun exposed areas of the body including the backs of hands, forearms, ears and the face. PCT presents as fragile skin with blisters, erosions (shallow ulcers), crusts, milia and scars. Darkening of the skin (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), abnormal growth of hairs particularly on the sides of the face (hypertrichosis), scarring and hardening of the skin (sclerodermoid changes) may also be present in the sun exposed areas. The condition most commonly affects individuals in midlife between 30 to 50 years. However, it can also affect children in rare cases. How is it diagnosed? Usually the doctor will suspect PCT as a result of taking a medical history and examining the skin. A number of medications may cause photosensitivity eruptions that may resemble the changes seen in PCT. These include non-steroideal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs, e.g. naproxen and mefanamic acid), antibiotics (e.g. nalidixic acid, tetracycline, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin) and diuretics (e.g. frusemide, hydrochlorthiazide). The diagnosis will be confirmed by undertaking some specific investigations. How is it treated? All individuals with PCT should be assessed and treated for associated medical problems. It is essential that individuals avoid UV light exposure by wearing protective clothing and applying a SPF50 or SPF50+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen regularly to prevent further damage to the skin. Individuals should eliminate aggravating factors such as alcohol ingestion, oestrogen therapy and drugs causing photosensitivity if applicable. In those with an iron overload, regular phlebotomy, which involves taking blood out of the body, or iron chelation, which involves administrating medication to remove extra iron from the body, may be indicated. Low dose antimalarial medication may help with excretion of the porphyrins. What is the likely outcome of porphyria cutanea tarda? When affected individuals avoid triggering factors and comply with specific treatments suggested by the doctor, the skin lesions will most likely disappear over time. Follow up All individuals with PCT require regular follow up to monitor their response to treatment and to ensure that no serious adverse events to the treatment develop.

        "Port-wine Stain": "Also known as … Capillary Malformation in modern terminology, as well as Nevus Flammeus A port-wine stain is a pink to red flat patch on the skin which has well-defined edges.  It is a true birthmark present in 3 to 5 per 1000 newborn babies. It is permanent and its area will increase in proportion to general body growth. Port-wine stain should not be confused with other pink patches present at birth such as the stork bite mark. The stork bite mark (angel’s kiss, salmon patch) on the central forehead is very common and will usually go away by itself in the first or second year of life. Port-wine stain is in the family of disorders known as vascular malformations. These are not the same as the far more common infantile haemangioma (strawberry birthmark) which is in the family of benign vascular tumours. Infantile haemangiomas are not usually present at birth. They have an early growth phase, become raised, and eventually shrink and disappear. Our understanding of the condition remains limited. The birthmark is thought to be due to a disturbance in the behaviour of blood vessels. The nerve control of blood flow is deficient and this results in blood flow being at maximum all the time. The capillaries within the port-wine stain remain wide open and this produces the typical red appearance. Normal skin will become red, for example, after sunburn, as a result of increased blood flow into the area. However, once the burn heals the blood vessels reduce to normal flow and the redness disappears. This normal behaviour cannot occur in a port-wine stain. Recently an abnormality in the GNAQ gene has been discovered in port-wine stain areas. However, this will need further corroborative studies. Port-wine stain is not hereditary. At birth, the port-wine stain is typically pink to red.  Although it is most commonly seen on the face, it can be present on any part of the body.  In some cases the port-wine stain will thicken and become darker in colour later in adult life. The thickening can be in the form of small dark lumps or the whole stain may thicken. Port-wine stain can be associated with certain syndromes. However, it is important to understand that the port-wine stain does not cause the syndrome but is simply a symptom of the condition. The diagnosis is usually obvious from the appearance of the stain and a history of presence at birth without further disproportionate growth. Further investigations will be required if an associated syndrome is suspected. Port-wine stain can be treated with laser. The specific laser used depends on whether the stain is in the flat pink stage or the bluish thickened appearance that sometimes develops in older adults. Treatment of flat pink childhood port-wine stain Treatment is recommended, particularly if the port-wine stain involves the face as it can be associated with teasing at school.  Treatment is best commenced as early possible as multiple treatment sessions are necessary. If a general anaesthetic is needed, this risk needs to be considered. There is a trend to commence treatment as soon as possible after birth. Treatment is initially given at intervals of between 2 to 4 weeks. Under the age of about 4 months this can be done without general anesthetic as the treatment is not particularly painful. As children become older, treatment generally requires general anesthetic. Treatment of adult-type thicker darker lesions Thicker lesions may be more resistant to treatment. They require more deeply penetrating laser and light systems. Depending on availability and preference, these systems include long pulsed Alexandrite laser, long pulsed Nd: YAG laser and some IPL systems. Safety of laser treatment Treatment of childhood port-wine stains has a very high safety profile with the use of modern lasers that have skin cooling. There are very rare instances of minor blistering and scarring. The more deeply penetrating lasers, as used in adult stains, carry a slightly higher risk of minor scarring.

        "Who gets adult acne?": "Adult acne is more frequently seen in women. It is usually less common in men. ",
        "What causes adult acne?": "Several factors may cause adult acne, including: It is unclear whether increased levels of male hormones (androgens) in the blood or small amounts of locally produced male hormones stimulate oil glands to produce more oil or sebum. Laboratory investigations are often normal in these patients. A dermatologist may look for evidence of increased hair growth, female patterned scalp hair loss and irregular menstruation. Other clinical features could be problems with infertility or signs of insulin resistance. Some medications may precipitate or aggravate acne. ",
        "What does adult acne look like?": "Adult acne usually looks like adolescent or teenage acne vulgaris. It often presents with whiteheads, blackheads, red bumps (papules), pimples and inflamed pus-filled spots (pustules, nodules, cysts), which can lead to scarring. Adult acne often occurs on the face around the lower cheeks, jawline and neck. In some cases, adult acne can develop on the back and chest. Increased oiliness may be noticed on the scalp. The post- inflammatory healing phase with redness or brown hyperpigmentation is also seen. The acne lesions are often tender and long lasting. Many women affected with adult acne experience a flare-up of their acne the week prior to their menstrual cycle. ",
        "How is adult acne diagnosed?": "Adult acne is diagnosed clinically by observing the presence of whiteheads, blackheads, red pumps, and pimples and inflamed pus-filled spots on the face, chest or back.

        "Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation": "What causes post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation? Inflammation (such as after acne, eczema, lichen planus, allergic reactions) or trauma to the skin (such as surgery, incorrect use of microdermabrasion, lasers or chemical peels) causes the release of inflammatory cells that cause melanocytes (pigment cells) to produce more pigment in the skin.  Severe inflammation or trauma can disrupt the bottom layer of the epidermis (first layer of the skin) causing the pigment to leak into and become trapped in the dermis (second layer of the skin). This results in a deeper and more treatment resistant pigmentation. Ultraviolet light exposure and certain medications (such as tetracycline antibiotics, antimalarial drugs and chemotherapeutic agents) can make the condition worse. What does post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation look like? Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is characterised by flat, tan, brown or black spots on the skin. This condition can occur on any area of the body, including in the mouth, the genital areas and on the nails. What other problems can occur with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation? Although this condition affects men and women equally, it is more common in those with skin of colour (pigmented skin). How is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation diagnosed? The condition is usually diagnosed by a physical examination performed by your dermatologist. In some cases a skin biopsy may be needed to distinguish this condition from other skin conditions that may have a similar appearance. Examples of other conditions that can look like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation include melasma, hyperpigmented pityriasis versicolor, lichen planus (macular variant), amyloidosis (macular variant) and hyperpigmented mycosis fungoides. A Wood’s lamp (a special light used to examine skin) can be useful in determining the depth of the pigment change. How is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation treated? Most cases resolve spontaneously without any treatment. Cosmetic camouflage (such as cosmetic foundations and concealers) can be helpful in disguising the difference in skin colour until recovery is complete. Speed of recovery can be improved with: What is the prognosis/likely outcome of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation? Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a benign process but may have significant cosmetic and psychosocial implications. The condition may take weeks or years to resolve depending on the initial cause, the colour of the person’s skin and if medical treatments are used to hasten recovery.

        "Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation": "What causes post-inflammatory hypopigmentation? Inflammation (such as eczema, seborrhoeic dermatitis) and trauma to the skin (such as cryotherapy or liquid nitrogen burns) may cause a temporary lightening of the skin and decrease in pigmentation by affecting the way melanocytes (pigment cells)  work and produce melanin (pigment). What does post inflammatory hypopigmentation look like? The condition presents as flat, non-scaly and lighter-than-normal areas of skin. What other problems can occur with post-inflammatory hypopigmentation? Although this condition affects men and women equally, it is more pronounced in people with skin of colour (pigmented skin) as the contrast between affected and non-affected skin is more noticeable. How is post-inflammatory hypopigmentation diagnosed? The condition is usually diagnosed by means of a physical examination carried out by your dermatologist. In some cases a skin biopsy may be needed to distinguish this condition from other skin conditions that may have a similar appearance. Acquired hypopigmentation may need to be differentiated from conditions such as pityriasis alba, pityriasis versicolor, vitiligo, lichen sclerosus and scarring. How is post-inflammatory hypopigmentation treated? Cosmetic camouflage techniques (such as cosmetic foundations and concealers) can be used to blend the normal and affected skin until the condition resolves. What is the prognosis/ likely outcome of post-inflammatory hypopigmentation? Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation is a benign (harmless) process but may have significant cosmetic and psychosocial implications. The condition usually resolves in weeks to months.

        "Miliaria": "Also known as heat rash, prickly heat or sweat rash What is miliaria? Miliaria is a group of skin conditions that arise from blockage of sweat ducts. There are three types of miliaria classified by the level of blockage of the sweat duct. These include miliaria crystalline, miliaria rubra and miliaria profunda. Who develops miliaria? Miliaria appears in about 15% of newborns. Babies are more commonly affected than children or adults as their sweat ducts are not yet fully developed. Adults may also be affected, particularly those who work in humid and hot conditions. What causes miliaria? Miliaria is caused by obstruction of sweat ducts, often from heat and excess sweating. Common situations in which blockage of the sweat ducts occurs include: No known diseases are associated with miliaria. What does miliaria look like? Miliaria commonly appears in areas of skin that have been blocked particularly around the neck and upper trunk in both children and adults. Other areas that can be affected include the groin, waistline, under the breasts, skin folds and armpits. Unlike acne, miliaria does not arise around hair follicles. Miliaria crystallina appears as small, superficial and clear blisters. These break easily from mild friction or bathing. Miliaria rubra appears as small, red flat or bumpy spots that are usually itchy. In chronic and recurrent cases, the lesions can turn into pus-filled spots. Miliaria profunda appears as deep red or white lumps that are prickly. These lesions are generally not itchy as they appear below the itch receptors. How is miliaria diagnosed? Miliaria is most often diagnosed based on the typical appearance of the lesions. The doctor may perform a simple diagnostic test where a fine needle is used to rupture the blister so that the clear fluid/sweat can be assessed. A biopsy of the skin may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish it from other conditions that look similar (e.g. erythema toxicum neonatorum, neonatal cephalic pustulosis, candidiasis, Grover’s disease). The doctor may also request a skin swab to rule out secondary infection. Individuals who develop heat stress syndrome may need to have blood tests. What other problems can occur with miliaria? Miliaria spots can become infected and form abscesses (pus-filled lumps). In addition, when a large surface area of the body is affected, affected individuals can develop a high temperature and suffer from heat stress syndrome. How is miliaria treated? Miliaria usually disappears after the body is cooled down. It is best prevented by avoiding overheating and over swaddling. More severe cases (e.g. miliaria profunda) can take several weeks to resolve as time is required for the plugs that block the opening of sweat ducts to be pushed outward by new sweat duct cells. General measures recommended to improve symptoms: Soothing lotions (e.g. calamine lotion) or topical steroids may help to relieve symptoms. Antiseptics and antibiotics may be recommended if a secondary infection is suspected. What is the likely outcome of miliaria? Miliaria usually disappears without any significant complications once the affected person is placed in a cool and ventilated environment. In rare cases where a person suffers from chronic and recurrent miliaria rubra or profunda, a large number of sweat glands may end up not functioning properly. This can lead to compensatory facial sweating. Individuals who develop secondary infection or heat stress syndrome need appropriate follow-up by the doctor.

        "Primary Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma": "Also known as … Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoma What is Primary Ctaneous B-cell Lymphoma (PCBCL)? Tumours of the lymph nodes and lymphatic system are called “lymphomas”. B-cell lymphomas are caused by an excess of B-cell lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCL) are a group of B-cell lymphomas that are localised to the skin, without evidence of disease beyond the skin at the time of diagnosis. PCBCL most commonly affects people over the age of 55 years. There are a number of types of PCBCL: PCDLBCL and other primary cutaneous intravascular large B-cell lymphoma are very rare and hence will not be discussed further. The cause of PCBCL is largely unknown. Previous infection with Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme disease has been associated with some cases of PCMZL. B-cell lymphomas comprise 20-25% of primary skin lymphomas. PCMZL presents as red to purple coloured lumps and bumps on the skin. The most common sites affected are the trunk, arms or head. The lesions may be single or multiple and usually cause no symptoms. PCFCL occur most commonly on the head, neck and trunk. Affected areas are reddish purple and raised. PCLBCL-LT presents with lumps and bumpy areas on one or both legs. Lesions are red to purple/blue in colour. Despite the name, this type of lymphoma can occur at other sites in 15% of cases. To make the diagnosis of PCBCL the following investigations are required: The method of treatment depends on the type of PCBCL present. Most cases would involve the expertise of a dermatologist and a haematologist in a specialised centre. For PCFCL and PCMZL which are indolent (low-grade) lymphomas, management options include: For PCDLBCL-LT, which is a more aggressive (intermediate-grade) type of lymphoma, management options include: The prognosis of PCBCL depends on the type of lymphoma diagnosed. This is an indolent (low-grade) lymphoma with an excellent prognosis. The 5-year survival rate is 99%. Spontaneous resolution (recovery) can occur. Following treatment recurrence (new skin lesions) is common (60%+). This does not imply a poorer prognosis. This is an indolent (low-grade) lymphoma with a very good prognosis. The 5-year survival rate is 95%. Spontaneous resolution (recovery) can occur. Recurrence is common following treatment (60%+) but does not imply a worse prognosis. This is a more aggressive (intermediate-grade) lymphoma with a poorer prognosis and high risk of spread to other organs. The 5-year survival rate is less than 50%.

        "Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy": "Also known as … Recurrent Cholestasis of Pregnancy, Obstetric Cholestasis, Cholestasis of Pregnancy, Recurrent Jaundice of Pregnancy, Cholestatic Jaundice of Pregnancy, Idiopathic Jaundice of Pregnancy, Prurigo gravidarum, Icterus Gravidarum What is it? Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a rare liver condition which causes an itchy skin. There is no rash but the skin may show scratch marks (excoriations) or become yellow (jaundiced). This condition typically develops late in pregnancy and resolves within days after the baby is born. Closer monitoring of the pregnancy is recommended as this condition can have serious effects on the unborn baby.  The cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is unknown. The liver becomes less able to clear certain substances. Bile acids and bilirubin accumulate in the blood and cause an itchy skin. This condition sometimes runs in families. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically occurs in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Symptoms often begin on the palms of hands and soles of feet after which a widespread itchy skin develops. The skin may appear normal or show scratch marks and turn yellow as the condition progresses. Some women experience fatigue, nausea or abdominal discomfort. This condition is potentially serious for the unborn baby with an increased risk of foetal distress, preterm labour and stillbirth. In severe cases the mother may be less able to absorb vitamin K causing her to be prone to bleeding around the time of delivery. A diagnosis is made on a special blood test that shows an elevation in bile acid levels.  Liver function tests may be abnormal. A coagulation profile is often included in blood investigations to assess the risk of bleeding. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is usually treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, an oral medication that lowers bile acid levels, relieves itch and improves foetal outcome. Treatment should be started promptly and continued until the baby is born. Careful obstetric and paediatric care is important and babies may be delivered early. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy improves within a few days of delivery.  However it usually recurs in subsequent pregnancies and may also recur with commencement of the oral contraceptive pill.

        "Prurigo nodularis": "What is prurigo nodularis? Prurigo nodularis is an intensely itchy, abraded (severely scratched-looking) rash characterised by discreet, thickened and leathery nodules or bumps. The condition usually occurs on the outer surfaces of the arms and legs. It is considered to be a localised form of lichen simplex chronicus which is a chronic condition characterised by itchy and thickened skin. The condition occurs in all age groups and equal numbers of males and females are affected. Abrasions are usually pronounced. Affected people experience intense and periodic itch which is profoundly disabling. Under the microscope, the condition closely resembles eczema. What does prurigo nodularis look like? A nodule of prurigo nodularis is firm to the touch. It is usually appears as a large dome-shaped, wart-like growth up to 3 cm in diameter. The lesions start as small, red, itchy papules or rounded skin bumps. Scratching leads to weeping ulcers which crust and scale. As the nodule ages, it often changes colour – usually brown-black but sometimes pale-coloured. The in-between skin can be dry and scaly. Nodules usually occur in groups. These groups vary in number from singles to hundreds. They are distributed symmetrically, most commonly on the outer surfaces of the arms and legs. However, the face, trunk and even palms can be involved. New lesions may continue to present and some existing nodules heal, usually leaving a scar. What causes prurigo nodularis? There is an identifiable cause in the majority of cases. In 50% of cases, an inherited condition such as asthma, eczema, hay fever or hives is present. This is known as “atopy”. Prurigo nodularis can occur in stasis eczematous dermatitis (a common form of dermatitis of the lower legs which is associated with pooling or “stasis” of blood in the veins). It also occurs in those affected with nummular eczema (a common type of eczema with distinct, coin-shaped sores), lichen simplex and insect-bite reactions. In rare cases, the condition can be seen with pemphigoid nodularis (a rare autoimmune skin disease which usually presents with big blisters) and dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy blistering skin condition associated with coeliac disease). In 30% of cases, a metabolic or biochemical cause induces itch such as: Less common causes are thyroid disease, neurologic disease (stroke), hypercalcaemia (high calcium in the blood) and lymphoma (cancer of the blood). The remaining 20% of affected people have psychological factors such as depression, anxiety and/or psychosis. Nutritional deficiency most often shows in the blood as decreased iron absorption. Most often, it is diet-related with added loss (i.e. underlying iron deficiency because of eating habits in a female with excess menstrual iron loss). Malabsorption of iron (compromised absorption of iron in the gut) can occur with gluten hypersensitivity but most commonly following bowel surgery. Gastrointestinal bleeding is another cause of iron deficiency. Those affected with the prurigo nodularis often have all three causative factors (atopic, psychological and nutritional). Atopic dermatitis can be triggered and perpetuated by acute depression and then aggravated by nutritional problems – the “lonely, malnourished depressive”. The eczema tendency, depression and diet must all be treated – not only the itchy nodules. How is prurigo nodularis diagnosed? The condition is usually diagnosed from its clinical appearance as an extremely itchy dermatitis, characterised by persistent nodules. Skin biopsy shows the microscopic picture of eczema. It differs from lichen simplex chronicus only by its dome shape. How is prurigo nodularis treated? Injected and topical steroids are the mainstay of therapy for the nodules. Simple topical therapy is doomed to fail. Oral steroids are often necessary and are used in conjunction with super potent topical corticosteroids which are applied under plastic wrap to enhance their effect. Other treatments include: What is the likely outcome of PN? The condition is difficult to cure because it depends on the absolute resolution of the underlying disorder. Remission can be expected when the affected person is faithful to the treatment regime. The course of prurigo nodularis is chronic. The affected person is often miserable. Suicidal tendencies can occur. This information has been written by Dr Malcolm Lane-Brown\nUpdated 02 July 2015 Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

The average age of onset has been between 23 and 27 years, however it can occur at any age. Most reports of prurigo pigmentosa have come from Japan. The cause of prurigo pigmentosa is not known. There have been proposed theories suggesting associations with allergies and irritation from contact with clothing material. Prurigo pigmentosa has been associated with fasting or very low carbohydrate diets (ketogenic diets). The rash usually develops rapidly on the back, neck and chest in a symmetric fashion. It typically presents as red, inflamed, raised spots that appear quickly and as they heal they leave a flat brown net like pattern behind. Face, arms, legs, hair, nails and mucous membranes are rarely affected.  There have been reports of blistering forms of prurigo pigmentosa. A dermatologist usually makes the diagnosis through history and examination of the skin. It can sometimes require a skin biopsy if the diagnosis is unclear. Treatment options include: Prurigo pigmentosa associated with ketosis can be treated with correction of ketosis through increasing carbohydrate intake or administering insulin in particular cases. The skin changes of prurigo pigmentosa usually heal within weeks. It can leave a net like appearance of darker mottled skin. This eventually fades with time.

        "Pruritus ani": "What is pruritus ani? The term “pruritus ani” refers to an ‘itchy bottom’. This is a common and distressing problem for many people. It occurs most commonly in middle-aged white men. There are many simple things that can be done to help ease the symptoms. However, treatment may not completely cure the problem. What causes pruritus ani? Pruritus ani can be caused by skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus or by other factors such as haemorrhoids or bowel problems such as “anal fissure”. In young children or parents of young children, pinworm infection is a common cause. Other infections such as herpes or candida can also be responsible. Some health problems such as diabetes or underactive thyroid may also cause itching. What does pruritus ani look like? The skin is often non-specific in appearance. In acute cases the skin can be red, scratched and even have fissures, which can be painful. In chronic cases, the skin can become thickened through rubbing and scratching. What other problems can occur with pruritus ani? Repeated itching and scratching can cause an ongoing itch-scratch-itch cycle. How is pruritus ani diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made by observation and history taking by your GP. Infection can be excluded by taking a swab of the affected area. If there is a rash visible, a dermatologist may be helpful in diagnosing the condition. A colorectal surgeon may need to be seen for a telescope test known as a “proctoscopy”. How is pruritus ani treated? Products such as Anusol®, Rectinol® etc contain anaesthetics and preservatives that can actually make the condition worse. Some medications prescribed by your doctor can also cause an allergic reaction. This is easier said than done. Repeated scratching and rubbing will lead to thickening of the skin (lichen simplex chronicus) and ongoing itch. It is important to break the itch-scratch-itch cycle. Soap, shampoo, bubble baths etc remove all natural oils from the skin making it dry and itchy. In the shower or bath use a soap-free wash and use low soap shampoo such as Dermaveen®, Aveeno®, and QV® etc. Avoid over washing the area. Avoid long hot baths or showers. Hot spas and swimming in chlorinated pools can also irritate the skin. Soft, non-perfumed toilet paper should be used. Avoid harsh wiping, as this will damage the skin. Some people find that wiping with cotton wool balls dipped in water is better than using toilet paper.. Others find that a quick, cool shower after going to the toilet can help. If sweating makes the itching worse, folding a tissue into a small square and placing this on the area to absorb excess moisture during the day may be helpful. Avoid nylon underwear. Men should wear 100% cotton boxer shorts only. Some people find that hot or spicy food containing chilli exacerbates the itch. A high fibre diet may also be useful if loose bowel actions are a contributing factor. Avoid vinyl or leather chairs if your occupation involves lots of sitting. The best type of chair is one with an open weave such as a woven rattan. Alternatively, placing a folded cotton towel on the seat can help. Although it is unlikely that surgery will be needed, a colorectal surgeon is the best person to perform a “proctoscopy”. A short telescope is inserted into the anus to look for simple things that can cause itching such as a small tear (anal fissure), skin tags, haemorrhoids, warts, anal sphincter problems etc. A dermatologist will examine the area as well as other parts of the body to determine if the itch is being caused by a skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis. These common skin conditions cause pruritus ani. However, there are many other causes. Occasionally a skin biopsy needs to be taken to rule out these other causes. Allergy testing (patch testing) may be required. Blood tests can occasionally be helpful (eg to check for diabetes). Low strength steroid ointments are often required. Strong steroid ointments should be avoided in this area as they can cause skin thinning after long-term use.  Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Pruritus with no rash": "What is “pruritus with no rash”? Pruritus means itch. Itch is a very common symptom of skin disorders such as eczema, scabies, insect bites and hives. These skin disorders are characterised by the presence of a rash. Some people will have pruritus without a skin disorder. These individuals are often referred to as having “pruritus with no rash.” What causes “pruritus with no rash”? “Pruritus with no rash” may be due to: What does “pruritus with no rash” look like? The natural human response to itch is to scratch the skin. The act of scratching at the skin unfortunately causes more itch, which is then followed by more scratching and further itch. This vicious cycle is known as the “itch-scratch cycle”. The changes seen on the skin in “pruritus with no rash” are due to scratching and rubbing. These changes include: How is “pruritus with no rash” diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist and is based on a medical history (including review of current medications) and skin examination. A skin biopsy may be needed to exclude an underlying skin disorder as the cause of the itch. Skin scrapings and swabs may be needed if an infestation or infection is suspected. A “pruritus screen” is typically ordered to identify any underlying disease of the internal organs. This may include a combination of blood, urine, stool and radiographic tests. How is “pruritus with no rash” treated? There are three general principles for treating “pruritus with no rash”. The most important of these principles is to identify any underlying cause and reverse or treat this cause, if possible. General anti-pruritic measures include: Specific anti-pruritic therapies include: What is the likely outcome of “pruritus with no rash”? The outcome depends on the underlying cause of the pruritus and whether this can be treated and/or reversed.

        "Pseudofolliculitis Barbae": "Also known as…Razor Bumps, Shave Bumps, Barber’s Itch, Folliculitis Barbae Traumatica What is Pseudofolliculitis Barbae? Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is a chronic inflammation of hair-bearing areas of the skin caused by ingrown hairs that develop after shaving or plucking. This condition is more often seen in individuals with curly hair on the beard area and nape of the neck. Newly cut or shaved hair, especially when coarse and curly, tends to curl back and the sharp point penetrates the skin and causes a foreign-body reaction in the skin.  The hair shaft itself may have some structural weakness. This weakness in the hair may be inherited/passed down through families (i.e. genetic hair shaft weakness). This can contribute to the development of Pseudofolliculitis Barbae. Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is most commonly seen in the beard area of men of African background who have short, coarse and curly hair and who shave regularly. The condition may also be seen (though it is far less common) on other parts of the body that are shaved. Multiple red, skin coloured or brown lumps centred around the hair follicle are seen on the beard area (cheeks, chin and front of neck) and back (nape) of the neck. Sideburns and the moustache are normally not affected. As the condition progresses, larger lumps may develop and complications such as keloid scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may occur. Formal tests are not required to reach a diagnosis.  The dermatologist would need to distinguish this condition from a bacterial or fungal infection of the hair follicles. The best treatment is to allow the hair to grow out. Changing shaving practices will improve the condition: Chemical hair removers such as depilatory creams have been used but may cause irritation to the surrounding skin. If inflammation occurs, it can be successfully treated with certain steroid creams. A variety of alternative treatments are available such as steroid injections (intralesional steroids) and topical eflornithine hydrochloride. Laser hair removal and electrolysis may be used in cases that are not responsive to simple measures. Complications such as scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can be treated if necessary. Relapses occur frequently unless shaving practices are addressed and changed.

        "What is central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is a chronic and progressive type of scarring alopecia that results in permanent hair loss. CCCA most commonly starts in the centre of the scalp and, without treatment, expands over time causing an irreversible area of baldness. ",
        "Who gets central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "CCCA is most commonly seen in middle-aged African women. ",
        "What causes central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "The cause of CCCA is unknown, but it is likely that genetic factors and several hair care practices may cause CCCA, such as: Mutations in PAD13 gene, which encodes a hair protein has been associated with CCCA.1 ",
        "What does central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia look like?": "CCCA only affects the scalp. The bald patch starts in the central part of the scalp (vertex or crown) and gradually expands outwards symmetrically (centrifugal). It may progress slowly (over decades) or rapidly (over years) resulting in patches of permanent hair loss (baldness). There is often a bald patch with shiny skin (scarring) seen in the centre of the scalp. Traction alopecia (loss of hair in areas of high tension) or hair breakage is also a feature. Individuals with CCCA may also experience tenderness, pain, tingling, burning, “pins and needles” or itching of the scalp.  In some cases, crusts, pimples and scale may also be present and the scalp may feel soft or ‘boggy’ when touched. However, sometimes there are no symptoms other than an area of hair loss present. ",
        "How is central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia diagnosed?": "Early diagnosis is important so that treatment can be started to prevent further permanent hair loss. CCCA is diagnosed clinically. A skin biopsy of the affected area of scalp should be taken to understand the presence of inflammatory cells around the hair follicles, loss of the sebaceous glands (oil glands) and premature damage of the hair follicle. Skin scrapings and swabs may also be required if scale, crust and/or pimples are present to exclude the possibility of fungal or bacterial infections. ",
        "How is central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The aim of treatment is to improve symptoms and stop further hair loss. Treatment of CCCA involves changing haircare practices and avoiding: Anti-inflammatory agents may also be used such as: Cosmetic camouflage (e.g. wigs) and hair transplantation may be an option for individuals who have significant bald patches seen in the advanced stages of CCCA. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia?": "Without early treatment, CCCA is likely to progress over years eventually causing severe, non-reversible scarring and permanent hair loss (bald patches).

        "Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum": "Also known as … Grönblad–Strandberg Syndrome Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a progressive systemic disorder resulting from the accumulation of calcium and minerals in the elastic fibres of the connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to your body structures. PXE can affect the elastic fibres in the skin, as well as the eyes, blood vessels and sometimes the digestive tract. It affects approximately 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a genetic disorder caused by mutation in the ABCC6 gene. This gene is important for making proteins found in cells of the liver, kidneys, skin, stomach, blood vessels and eyes. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means a person must have received both copies of the mutated genes from their parents to be affected. Most people can carry a copy of the mutated gene but not have the condition. People with PXE often have small yellowish bumps (papules) on their skin that resemble skin of a “plucked chicken”. the skin can become lax and redundant in advanced stages. These changes are typically seen on the neck, armpits and inner surface of joints. The abnormal deposition of minerals in PXE can cause abnormalities in the: Obstetric complications: increased risk of miscarriage in the first trimester, worsening of the skin & systemic complications during pregnancy. The diagnosis can be made clinically. A skin biopsy may be needed from skin lesions. It is formally diagnosed via genetic testing. Imaging, eye exam & further testing may be needed to assess other organs involvement. No specific treatment for PXE exists. The most important aspect of management is to ensure that complications are prevented & dealt with by the appropriate specialist. Regular Surveillance for complications is often recommended. Lifestyle precautions Despite the possibility of PXE to affect multiple organs, most affected individuals live a normal life span. Affected individuals should be aware of the potential complications and to look out for these symptoms.

Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic pustular condition affecting the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet. It may occur with psoriasis or without any other skin disease. The cause of PPP is not completely understood. PPP affects the eccrine sweat glands which are most common on the palms and soles. It may be autoimmune in origin. Genetic factors are important as several members of some families may be affected. PPP presents as crops of itchy or sore pustules on the palms and/or soles. PPP can occur on one or both hands and/or feet. Scaly red patches may also be seen in association with the pustules. In the more chronic stages of the disease, the skin can be dry and thickened with deep fissures (cracks in the skin). There is usually a sharp demarcation between the normal and affected skin areas. PPP varies in severity and may persist for many years. The discomfort can be considerable, interfering with work and affecting quality of life. A form of PPP which affects the tips of the fingers is called acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau or acropustulosis. It can lead to destruction of the fingernail on affected digits. Certain conditions have been reported to occur in individuals with PPP: In most cases, the diagnosis is made by clinical examination. In rare cases, a biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Skin scrapings can exclude fungal infections that may mimic PPP.  Skin swabs may be taken to exclude a bacterial infection but will be negative in uncomplicated PPP. Treatment of PPP can be difficult. The condition can also respond poorly to therapy. Less severe cases can usually be managed with topical treatments. More severe cases may require physical or systemic therapy. General measures Topical treatments Light treatment Systemic treatment Systemic treatments include tablets or injections that require regular monitoring.

        "Pyoderma gangrenosum": "What is pyoderma gangrenosum? Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare cause of chronic, recurrent and painful non-infectious skin ulcers. It is classified as a neutrophilic dermatosis (skin disorder that has dense infiltration of inflammatory cells called neutrophils). It affects both males and females but is more common in females aged between 20 and 50 years. It rarely affects infants and children. What causes pyoderma gangrenosum? The cause of this condition is unknown. It is commonly associated with an underlying autoimmune condition (when our own immune cells attack our body). Minor skin injuries may also trigger the development of these ulcers. What does pyoderma gangrenosum look like? The appearance of the condition varies from person to person. Lesions appear as small pus-filled pimples, red bumps or blood-filled blisters. These lesions turn into painful ulcers with pus and grow in size very quickly. There is usually a single large lesion. However, multiple lesions can also appear simultaneously.  They can appear with other symptoms such as fever, muscle aches and joint pains. Although lesions can appear on any part of the skin, the lower legs and hands are most commonly involved. What other problems can occur with pyoderma gangrenosum? The condition is commonly associated with an underlying disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease), arthritis or bone marrow disorder (e.g. a myeloproliferative disorder). How is pyoderma gangrenosum diagnosed? It is difficult to diagnose pyoderma gangrenosum as there is no specific test for the condition. It is important to rule out other causes for ulcers such as trauma, infection, problems with blood vessels (venous or arterial insufficiency) and drug reactions. The treating doctor will take a detailed past medical history and blood tests will be needed to look for any medical condition. A skin biopsy is needed to rule out other causes for the ulcers but, unfortunately, although supportive, it is not diagnostic for the disease. A wound swab and tissue culture may be needed if a bacterial infection is suspected.  Further testing may be required if an underlying medical condition is suspected. The final diagnosis will be based on all the clinical and laboratory information. How is pyoderma gangrenosum treated? The aim of treatment is to control the inflammation and treat any underlying disease. There are two main forms of anti-inflammatory treatment: Strong topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors can be applied to the affected lesions. Steroids may be injected into the lesions to reduce inflammation. When lesions are present on the legs, the doctor may suggest elevating the legs and applying compression bandaging with caution to reduce swelling. Bio-occlusive dressings may also facilitate wound healing when there is no active infection or inflammation. Oral steroids are used to reduce inflammation together with immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, tacrolimus, TNF-alpha inhibitors, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, immunoglobulins. Side effects of these medications need to be monitored closely by a doctor. Surgery should be avoided as it can lead to enlargement of the lesions. What is the likely outcome of pyoderma gangrenosum? Pyoderma gangrenosum is a treatable condition but it may take months to heal completely. When the underlying disease is treated, the lesions tend to improve. As affected individuals have different medical illnesses and lesions differ in their severity, the outcome of pyoderma gangrenosum differs from person to person. Regular follow-up with the treating doctor is crucial for close monitoring of the condition. The adverse effects of oral therapy should be discussed thoroughly with a doctor prior to and during treatment.

        "Pyogenic Granuloma": "Also known as Lobular capillary haemangioma What is a pyogenic granuloma? A pyogenic granuloma is a common benign (not malignant) growth of blood vessels on the skin. It appears as a single fast growing red nodule that commonly bleeds. Whilst benign, pyogenic granulomas can be distressing due to their appearance and fast growth. What causes a pyogenic granuloma? The exact cause of a pyogenic granuloma is not known however minor trauma is thought to play a role in their development. Hormones are also thought to play a role, as pregnant women are more likely to develop a pyogenic granuloma inside their mouth. Pyogenic granulomas can occur in anyone but are more common in young children and in females. They can occur anywhere on the body but are more common on the head and neck, upper trunk and hands, especially on the fingers. What does a pyogenic granuloma look like? Pyogenic granulomas usually appear and grow very quickly (usually over days to weeks). Pyogenic granulomas are usually bright red and have a shiny surface. They grow out of the skin and can have a stalk. They tend to bleed very easily, even with a minor bump, and can form a crust over the top. They can become darker red in colour with time. They may be lumpy on the surface like a raspberry. Pyogenic granulomas are not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person. They do not turn into cancers and are not usually painful. How is a pyogenic granuloma diagnosed? A dermatologist can make the diagnosis based on the appearance of the lesion and the history of rapid growth. A biopsy may be performed in order to confirm the diagnosis. How is pyogenic granuloma treated? In general, a pyogenic granuloma will not disappear without treatment.  However, cases of pyogenic granuloma developing during pregnancy have been known to resolve without treatment once the pregnancy is over. Whilst benign and painless, pyogenic granulomas tend to be a nuisance because they bleed easily and can be unsightly. The most common treatment is “curettage and cautery” which involves surgically scraping off the pyogenic granuloma and sealing the bleeding. Pyogenic granulomas have a high risk of recurring and occasionally need to be surgically excised (cut out with stitches) which gives the best possible chance of them not growing back. Any fast growing lesion on the skin that bleeds should be seen by a specialist dermatologist to ensure it is not skin cancer.

        "Raynaud phenomenon": "What is Raynaud phenomenon? Raynaud phenomenon is an intermittent constriction of the blood flow to the fingers and toes precipitated by cold, emotion and some drugs that cause spasm of the small arteries bringing blood to the fingers and toes. The fingers become cooler, look blue and white. Then as the episode passes and the blood flow returns, the affected fingers and toes become red, warm and may be uncomfortable. What causes it? The condition may occur on its own without evidence of underlying disease but may be part of an underlying autoimmune connective tissue disorder or other disorder. There are two forms of the condition: What does it look like? A typical attack consists of a sudden sensation of cold associated with well-defined pallor (white discoloration) of one or more digits. This is followed a few minutes later by cyanosis (bluish color) or sometimes by erythema (red color). In primary Raynaud phenomenon involvement is usually symmetrical and involves several digits. In secondary Raynaud phenomenon, only one or a few digits are affected and asymmetry is not unusual. Severe cases are usually of the secondary type and may be complicated by permanent damage to the affected extremities. Attacks may be painful, can last from minutes to hours and may occur infrequently or many times each day. The condition most commonly affects the hands but sometimes involves the feet or other sites such as the nose or earlobes. How is it diagnosed? Evaluation of people with Raynaud phenomenon includes a detailed history and physical examination to differentiate between the primary and secondary forms of the condition. Further investigations will be needed if an underlying cause is suspected. How is it treated?\nIndividuals with Raynaud phenomenon need to use treatment strategies to avoid or reduce the frequency of attacks. General measures The following measures can help control symptoms in people with primary Raynaud phenomenon. Further management of secondary Raynaud Phenomenon depends on controlling the underlying disease (such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus) or other conditions that reduce the blood flow to the hands and feet. People with underlying disease may need a more potent medication such as sildenafil and prostacyclin infusions may be used to increase the blood flow to the hands and feet. What is the likely outcome of Raynaud phenomenon? The condition tends to run a variable course. In primary Raynaud phenomenon the outcome is good in 80% of cases but some disability may occur in 20% of cases. In secondary Raynaud phenomenon the prognosis is dependent on resolution of the underlying disease.

        "Striae": "Also known as stretch marks, striae rubra (red stretch marks), striae alba (white stretch marks) What is striae? Stretch marks are extremely common, affecting over 70% of the population. There are two types of stretch marks – striae rubra (red or new stretch marks) and striae alba (white or old stretch marks). New stretch marks are more responsive to treatment than old stretch marks. What causes striae? Stretch marks, as the name suggests, are due to stretching of the skin, which results in altered structural support in the deeper layers of the skin. Microscopic studies of stretch marks show alteration in collagen and diminished elastin, as well as dermal oedema (swelling). Early stretch marks exhibit an increase in the number of blood vessels and inflammation, resulting in pink-purple discolouration. What do striae look like? The first signs of stretch marks are pink to purple lines usually running crosswise on the trunk and lengthwise along the limb. Early stretch marks may be itchy. Over time stretch marks lighten and develop a pale, wrinkled appearance known as striae alba. Stretch marks most commonly occur on the abdomen, inner arms, the back and breast areas. Stretch marks may also develop in the groin and armpits if high strength steroid creams are inappropriately used in these areas. What other problems can occur with striae? How are striae diagnosed? Stretch marks most often occur in otherwise normal individuals and no investigations are needed to make a diagnosis. Stretch marks may occur in people who have Cushing’s, Marfan’s or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Investigations are determined from clinical examination. How is striae treated? Stretch marks are a cosmetic problem and treatment is optional. The majority of stretch marks will fade over time. Early red stretch marks respond better to treatment than older, white stretch marks. No treatment will remove stretch marks completely. Treatment of red stretch marks Treatment of white stretch marks White stretch marks can be very difficult to treat. Expect only a mild to modest improvement with multiple sessions. Treatment methods include: What is the likely outcome of striae? The majority of stretch marks will improve over time, changing colour from red-purple to pink, then finally achieving a white wrinkled appearance. Treating early stretch marks with laser treatment combined with vitamin A creams gives the best outcome.

        "What causes rhinophyma?": "The cause of rhinophyma is unknown but it is linked to rosacea. ",
        "What does rhinophyma look like?": "The nasal skin slowly thickens and develops nodules (lumps), eventually causing a larger, bulbous, misshapen looking nose. The oil glands are enlarged, and the pores are more prominent. The majority of individuals with rhinophyma also have inflammatory rosacea, with acne-like lumps and bumps and sometimes pustules affecting the central face. The nose and surrounding skin are often red with an increased numbers of blood vessels. Figure 1. Rhinophyma – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Davin Lim ",
        "How is rhinophyma diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made clinically based on physical examination of the skin. ",
        "How is rhinophyma treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. It involves managing the underlying rosacea and treatment directed towards the thickened nasal skin. Typically, individuals with rosacea and rhinophyma will require oral medication to reduce the inflammation. The most commonly used medications are tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline, minocycline). A low dosage of isotretinoin may also be effective in shrinking enlarged oil glands. However, the mainstay of treatment is surgical removal of the thickened and redundant skin. This may include: ",

        "Tinea capitis": "Also known as ringworm of the scalp What is tinea capitis? Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp and hair. It most commonly affects children between three to seven years of age but adults can also be affected. What causes tinea capitis? Tinea capitis is caused by a dermatophyte fungus. Infection may result from direct contact with an infected person, animal or from contact with a contaminated object (known as a fomite), e.g. hairbrush, comb, hat, towel, pillowcase or linen. The fungal spores can live for a few months on contaminated objects and infect a new person. There are two major families of dermatophyte fungus that infect the scalp – Trichophyton (abbreviated as T) and Microsporum (abbreviated as M) fungi. These fungi are classified according to where they most naturally and easily grow e.g. in humans (anthropophilic), in animals (zoophilic) and in soil (geophilic). The most common causes of tinea are T. tonsurans and M. canis. T. tonsurans is usually passed from one infected person to another. M. canis is passed on from an infected animal such as a kitten or a dog to a human. Tinea capitis is more commonly found in crowded living environments. What does tinea capitis look like? Some people present with dry itchy scaly areas on the scalp with patches of hair loss (alopecia) that grow slowly over months. Some people present with black dots in the areas of hair loss. The black dots are the broken off hairs near the scalp. Some people may develop an angry red mass (kerion) with pus and yellow crusts together with patches of hair loss. Others develop large yellow crusts throughout the scalp (scutula). Individuals affected with tinea capitis commonly have enlarged lymph glands on the back of their necks and ears. How is tinea capitis diagnosed? Tinea capitis is diagnosed by a doctor. The doctor will suspect the diagnosis based on the appearance of the scalp and can confirm it by taking hair plucks and scrapings from scalp skin and having these examined under a microscope and sending them for culture. The doctor may use a special light called a Wood’s light (long wave ultraviolet light) to identify some types of fungi. In cases that are not typical, the dermatologist may also request a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. What other problems can occur with tinea capitis? When tinea capitis is not treated early and correctly, it can cause permanent hair loss with scarring. More severe infections can be associated with systemic symptoms such as feeling unwell with fevers, pain in involved areas and enlarged lymph glands. Some people can experience a dermatitis or eczema-like rash (called an id reaction) elsewhere on their body if the fungal infection is very extensive or severe. How is tinea capitis treated? Treatment is started as soon as the dermatologist suspects the diagnosis because it can take several weeks to identify the fungus through cultures. Most cases need oral antifungal tablets such as griseofulvin, fluconazole, itraconazole or terbinafine. Griseofulvin is most commonly used first especially for children. Treatment can take up to 6 weeks. In some cases, the dermatologist may request blood tests to check liver function. In cases that fail to respond, other antifungal agents may be needed. In addition to medication, it is very important that the affected person also uses antifungal shampoos such as 2% ketoconazole shampoo to decrease the chances of spreading the infection whilst the tablet is taking effect. Close family members should do the same. All hairbrushes, combs, hats, towels, pillowcases and linen need to be disinfected (e.g. washed in hot water and ironed or treated with household bleach) to prevent the  condition from recurring. Schools should be notified especially if the fungus is a type that can be passed from person to person so that classmates can be examined by their doctor and treated if necessary. What is the likely outcome of tinea capitis? Most tinea capitis, when treated early and correctly, will not result in permanent hair loss or scarring. Follow up Individuals who are diagnosed with tinea capitis should be followed up by a dermatologist during and after the treatment to monitor for side effects and ensure clearance of disease.

        "What causes rosacea?": "The exact cause of rosacea is unknown. There could be a combination of factors involved including hereditary (genetic), environmental, vascular and inflammatory factors as well as reaction to the demodex mite (microscopic mite that lives on human skin, commonly called ‘eyelash mite’). Several factors can trigger or aggravate rosacea by dilating blood vessels and therefore increasing blood flow to the surface of the skin, and may include: ",
        "What does rosacea look like?": "Rosacea usually presents with blushing (facial flushing) which becomes more frequent and eventually leads to persistent facial redness which fluctuates in intensity. Small blood vessels dilate and become visible as telangiectasia (broken blood vessels) and the continual or episodic blushing may promote inflammation, causing red bumps to appear which can resemble teenage acne. The cheeks, chin and nose are most commonly affected. There are several types of rosacea which have their own distinctive features, including: Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea Papulopustular rosacea Swollen rosacea Ocular rosacea ",
        "How is rosacea diagnosed?": "In most cases, rosacea is diagnosed based on history and clinical signs such as typical red or blushed facial appearance with associated papules and pustules (bumps) and telangiectasia.

        "What causes cutaneous larva migrans?": "The condition is caused by the larvae of hookworms that infect dogs, cats and other animals. The infection of a human host usually occurs as a result of lying, sitting or walking barefoot on ground contaminated with animal faeces. The condition remains confined to the outer layers of the skin as the larvae are unable to penetrate the basement membrane to invade the deeper layers. ",
        "What does cutaneous larva migrans look like?": "Affected individuals may have intense localised itch that begins shortly after the hookworm penetrates the skin. Red, swollen lumps, fluid-filled lumps and/or one or more snake-like tracts appear as the condition progresses. Hundreds of such lesions may be found on a single individual. Non-specific dermatitis, blistering lesions and superimposed bacterial infection may make larva migrans more difficult to diagnose.

        "Sarcoidosis": "What is it? Sarcoidosis most commonly affects the lungs but can also affect the skin and other organs. It is characterised by the formation of “granulomas” in affected areas. These are organised collections of histiocytes (a special type of inflammatory cell). This condition tends to affect females more than males and is most common between the ages of 20 to 40.  It affects people of African descent more frequently than Caucasians. What causes it? The underlying cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. The body’s immune system responds abnormally to an unknown trigger and leads to inflammation and granuloma formation. What does it look like? There are different manifestations of sarcoidosis in the skin and each type has its own distinctive appearance. What other problems can occur with this condition? This condition can affect any organ of the body. The skin is involved in about one third of cases.  The skin symptoms may be the first obvious sign of the condition and can lead to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in other organs. Common symptoms of multi-organ sarcoidosis are tiredness and weight loss. The condition often affects the lungs, and can cause a persistent dry cough, wheezing and shortness of breath.  Changes including enlarged lymph glands and scarring may be seen on chest x-ray. All other body systems can be affected including the eyes, nervous system, liver, heart and kidneys. Sarcoidosis can also result in raised blood and urinary calcium levels, which can increase the risk of kidney stones. How is it diagnosed? As there is no definitive diagnostic test, it is important to exclude other conditions that may mimic sarcoidosis.  Cutaneous sarcoidosis can be suspected from the appearance of the skin but a skin biopsy is often taken to support the diagnosis and exclude other conditions. Even though sarcoidosis may affect the skin alone, blood tests are usually taken to support the diagnosis (e.g. blood ACE levels) and assess the possibility of other organ involvement (e.g. liver function tests and blood calcium levels). As the lungs are commonly affected, lung function tests and a chest x-ray/CT scan are usually performed. Other physicians may be involved in the treatment depending on the organs affected (e.g. a chest physician may be involved to assess for lung involvement). How is it treated? Cutaneous sarcoidosis (sarcoidosis that affects the skin) may resolve on its own without treatment. However, the majority of people will need some form of treatment. What is the likely outcome of this condition? The likely outcome of this condition is difficult to predict. It may disappear spontaneously or require treatment over many years.

        "Impetigo": "Also known as…School Sores What is Impetigo? Impetigo is an infection of the skin that can be passed from person to person. It can affect skin that is intact (known as primary impetigo) or skin that is already compromised with cuts, abrasions, insect bites or other skin conditions such as eczema (known as secondary impetigo or impetiginisation). Generally, the condition affects younger children but any age group can be affected. Impetigo is caused by bacteria, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus (also known as ‘Staph’) and less commonly Group A Streptococcus (GAS). These germs can pass from person to person by skin to skin contact or by using the same towels or bedding. Some factors such as hot humid weather, crowded living conditions, poor personal hygiene, an unhygienic work environment or a low or poorly functioning immune system can encourage the germs to infect the skin and cause impetigo. Impetigo can spread rapidly through families and school classes but it can also appear as an isolated case. In most people (about 70%), the rash starts with a red area which develops into small blisters filled with clear fluid or pus. The blisters join together and eventually break down leaving thick oozing crusts which have a characteristic golden yellow, honey colour known as “non-bullous impetigo”. This process usually takes about a week. Much less commonly, particularly in young children, the small blisters join together to form large, loose, floppy blisters known as “bullae” known as “bullous impetigo”. If the infection is deeper in the skin, an ulcer may form with a purplish colour around the outside and yellowish crust on top known as “ecthyma”. Most cases of impetigo clear without any ongoing problems if the infection is treated early.  As the patches clear up, the crusts tend to fall off and the areas usually heal without leaving scars. Temporary redness occurs in some cases. Serious problems occur very rarely. The bacteria can affect the deeper tissues of the skin causing “cellulitis”, the kidneys causing “post-streptococcal glomerunonephritis” or affect the heart. Most of these rare problems are caused by the germ Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The diagnosis is usually made by a doctor.  Treatment is started immediately based on the typical appearance of the rash. A swab of the affected skin may be taken to determine which bacteria is the cause and before treating with antibiotics.  A nose swab may also be taken to check for an underlying Staph infection. This condition is treated with antibiotics. Topical antibiotics are used if a small area of skin is affected. The crusts can be cleaned first with salty water (1 teaspoon of table salt is dissolved in a cup of hot water and left to cool) two to three times a day. Then a topical antibiotic such as topical mupiricin or fusidic acid is applied. Topicals antibiotics need to be used cautiously due to concerns of emerging resistance. Oral antibiotics are often needed if large areas of skin are involved or there are multiple patches.  Dicloxicillin or flucloxacillin are most commonly recommended. Other options include erythromycin, cephalexin or others depending on sensitivity of the particular offending bacteria. A full course (usually at least 7 days) should be completed. Oral antibiotics are also needed if the rash has large blisters (bullous impetigo) or is “ecthyma”. If Staph is grown from the nose swab, the nose will also need twice daily treatment with topical antibiotics (usually mupiricin) for 10 days. Children should be kept home from school or day care until all the crusted and/or blistered areas have cleared. If there is any other underlying skin condition, this should also be treated. Good personal hygiene is important. Nails should be kept short and clean and affected people should wash their hands frequently with antibacterial soap and water or waterless antibacterial cleansers. If the rash persists or you have any concerns, please see your dermatologist.

An epidermoid cyst is a benign walled-off cavity filled with keratin which originates from the hair follicle unit.  Epidermoid cysts are the most common type of cyst. They may be primary or they may arise from disrupted follicular structures due to trauma or comedone formation (blackheads). Multiple cysts may occur in the conjunction with acne vulgaris, Gardner syndrome and in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Tiny superficial epidermoid cysts are known as milia. Epidermoid cysts appear as flesh coloured to yellowish, firm, round nodules of variable size. A central pore or punctum may be present. They are usually symptomless but sometimes discharge a foul smelling, “cheese-like” material. Less frequently, the cysts can be painful due to inflammation or infection.

        "Seborrhoeic Dermatitis and Cradle Cap": "Seborrhoeic dermatitis is inflammation of the skin that usually occurs on areas of the body such as the head and trunk where there are a greater number of oil glands. The condition can occur in the first year of life when it is called “cradle cap” or develops from puberty onwards. Mild cases occurring on the scalp can affect many individuals and this is usually known as “dandruff”. Although the exact cause is unclear, seborrhoeic dermatitis is thought to involve an abnormal immune response against a fungal yeast organism called Malassezia. This fungal organism is found on the healthy skin of all people and is usually present in greater numbers on the areas of the body that produce the most oil (sebum). Whilst the majority of people have no problem with Malassezia being present on the skin, it is not known why some individuals develop an abnormal immune reaction against this organism. The main feature of seborrhoeic dermatitis is greasy white or yellowish scales occurring over a patch of inflamed red skin. It typically occurs on the scalp and central face around the nose and eyebrows, but may also affect the forehead, beard area and skin around the ears. The upper central chest and back may also be affected. In babies with “cradle cap” the scalp is usually affected but redness and scaling may also occur in skin crease areas such as the armpits, under the neck and groin. The condition usually resolves within the first 12 months of age. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is occasionally itchy. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in people who have psoriasis, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or HIV infection. Formal testing is not usually needed to reach a diagnosis of seborrhoeic dermatitis. In some cases skin scrapings may be taken for fungal culture. When the condition affects the scalp, shampoos containing tar or antifungal agents (such as selenium sulfide, ketoconazole, miconazole or ciclopirox) are usually effective. Creams containing antifungal and/or corticosteroid can be used for the face and trunk. Agents that help exfoliate the scaly skin such as salicylic acid are also useful. Treatment often needs to be used on a regular basis in order to clear the condition completely, with intermittent use thereafter to maintain long term control. In babies, cradle cap can be treated by softening the scales on the skin with a little olive oil applied before bathing, and then removing the scales gently with a cotton bud. Sometimes a cream containing a mild corticosteroid (such as hydrocortisone 1%) or an antifungal agent or a tar-based product may also be useful to clear the scaling. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is usually chronic and can wax and wane in severity over time. In adults some form of regular or occasional treatment is usually needed to keep the condition under control. Cradle cap in babies usually clears on average after 6 to 12 months of age but may take longer to clear in some infants.

Seborrhoeic Keratoses are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the skin. The exact cause of Seborrhoeic Keratoses is unknown although they do tend to occur more frequently with increasing age.  Their appearance is thought to be part of the normal ageing process of the skin. Seborrhoeic Keratoses are “wart-like” growths. They are usually raised above the surface of the skin and appear to be stuck on like “barnacles”. They can occur in varying shades of brown from light to very dark brown. The surface of Seborrhoeic Keratoses usually feels rough and warty. They can sometimes be dry and scaly and become itchy or irritated. Most people will have more than one Seborrhoeic Keratosis and some people may have hundreds scattered over the body.

People affected with Seborrhoeic Keratoses often complain that they “catch” on things, bleed or become inflamed, especially if they are large and warty. Seborrhoeic Keratoses are usually treated by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy). They can also be removed surgically by lightly scraping (shave excision or curretage) or burning the lesions (electrocautery).  Laser resurfacing (ablative laser) and strong medical-grade chemical peels may also be used. All methods of removal have an increased risk of permanent colour change (lightening or darkening) or scarring of the skin. Removing them will not prevent new lesions from developing in the future. There is no known effective prevention of these lesions. Seborrhoeic Keratoses do not cause any major health problems.

        "Pseudofolliculitis Barbae": "Also known as…Razor Bumps, Shave Bumps, Barber’s Itch, Folliculitis Barbae Traumatica What is Pseudofolliculitis Barbae? Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is a chronic inflammation of hair-bearing areas of the skin caused by ingrown hairs that develop after shaving or plucking. This condition is more often seen in individuals with curly hair on the beard area and nape of the neck. Newly cut or shaved hair, especially when coarse and curly, tends to curl back and the sharp point penetrates the skin and causes a foreign-body reaction in the skin.  The hair shaft itself may have some structural weakness. This weakness in the hair may be inherited/passed down through families (i.e. genetic hair shaft weakness). This can contribute to the development of Pseudofolliculitis Barbae. Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is most commonly seen in the beard area of men of African background who have short, coarse and curly hair and who shave regularly. The condition may also be seen (though it is far less common) on other parts of the body that are shaved. Multiple red, skin coloured or brown lumps centred around the hair follicle are seen on the beard area (cheeks, chin and front of neck) and back (nape) of the neck. Sideburns and the moustache are normally not affected. As the condition progresses, larger lumps may develop and complications such as keloid scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may occur. Formal tests are not required to reach a diagnosis.  The dermatologist would need to distinguish this condition from a bacterial or fungal infection of the hair follicles. The best treatment is to allow the hair to grow out. Changing shaving practices will improve the condition: Chemical hair removers such as depilatory creams have been used but may cause irritation to the surrounding skin. If inflammation occurs, it can be successfully treated with certain steroid creams. A variety of alternative treatments are available such as steroid injections (intralesional steroids) and topical eflornithine hydrochloride. Laser hair removal and electrolysis may be used in cases that are not responsive to simple measures. Complications such as scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can be treated if necessary. Relapses occur frequently unless shaving practices are addressed and changed.

        "Shingles": "Also known as herpes zoster, varicella zoster What is shingles? Shingles is a localised, blistering, red and painful rash. It can involve the chest, neck, abdomen, face or ear canal and central nervous system. What causes shingles? Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella virus, the same virus responsible for chicken pox. The virus can lie dormant in nerve cells once a person has contracted chicken pox and may be reactivated by stress, illness, immunosuppression, older age, trauma, radiotherapy and contact with another person with varicella or herpes zoster. What does the shingles rash look like? A person suffering from shingles may experience burning pain, stinging, itching or a change in sensation in affected skin. The person may have a fever and feel unwell. These symptoms may precede the appearance of the rash which consists of redness of the skin followed by blisters. The rash is a unilateral band-like eruption involving dermatomes (one-sided sections of skin related to the nerve supply to that area) of the chest, neck abdomen or face. It commonly stops at the midline but can occasionally involve multiple dermatomes or become bilateral. The acute phase settles over a 3-week period. Then it is followed by crusting and healing, and sometimes scarring. The oral cavity and ear canal can be affected in some cases. What problems can occur with shingles? Other rare complications include: Shingles in early pregnancy is unlikely to affect the foetus because of immunity in the past from varicella (chicken pox). You should seek prompt medical attention if shingles occurs in pregnancy. How is shingles diagnosed? How is it treated? How is post herpetic neuralgia treated? Prevention of shingles A vaccination for shingles has now been introduced because of the increasing frequency and severity of shingles in older people. The vaccine, called zostavax, consists of a live attenuated strain of varicella. The vaccine is recommended for people over the age of 60, and is free to people over the age of 70 in Australia. It consists of a single injection in the upper arm and is generally safe and well tolerated.  The most common side effect is redness and swelling at the injection site. This vaccination can reduce the severity of shingles and post herpetic neuralgia in older people.

        "Skin structure and function": "The skin is an organ that provides the outer protective wrapping for all the body parts. It is the largest organ in the body. It is a waterproof, airtight and flexible barrier between the environment and internal organs. It keeps the internal environment of our body stable. The skin is divided into 3 layers, the epidermis, the dermis and the subcutaneous layer. The diagram below shows how the different layers and parts of the skin are arranged. Epidermis The epidermis is the outer layer of the skin. It is a mosaic of cells glued together and its thickness depends on the location on the body. On the palms and soles the epidermis is thick, flexible and resists mechanical injury. On the eyelids it is very thin and allows maximum movement. The epidermis prevents loss of water and body fluids, resists mechanical and chemical injury and protects against bacteria, viruses and parasite infections. The pigment in the epidermis plays an important role in protecting the skin from ultraviolet radiation. The hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous (oil) glands and apocrine glands develop from the epidermal cells, but their deeper parts extend into the dermis. The glands open onto the surface of the skin via small ducts. Hair grows from the hair follicle, which is found in all skin except the palms and soles. Nails are specialised plates of hard keratin that develop from the epidermis overlying the small bones at the ends of the fingers and toes. There are 3 main groups of cells in the epidermis: The main cell in the epidermis is the keratinocyte, which develops from the bottom or basal layer and then migrates upwards over a period of about four weeks to the outer surface (stratum corneum) where it is shed. Langerhans cells are specialised immune cells that are an important part of the body’s immune response to foreign materials and infections. The melanocytes produce pigment. All humans have the same number of melanocytes. The difference in skin colour occurs because in darker skin melanocytes produce more pigment. The melanin pigment protects the cells of the epidermis and the tissues in the dermis from sun damage. Lighter skinned people are more susceptible to developing sun damaged skin because their melanocytes produce less melanin (skin pigment). Dermo-epidermal junction This is a complex region where the dermis and epidermis are attached to each other via specialised cells and molecules. It contains the basement membrane. Dermis The dermis lies beneath the epidermis and is 20 to 30 times thicker than the epidermis. It is composed of a dense network of specialised proteins (collagen and elastin) organised into fibres of differing sizes and properties.  A complex gel of different proteins surrounds these fibres. All together this is known as the extracellular matrix. Within the extracellular matrix are blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves, the bottom part of the hair follicles and sweat glands. Subcutis (subcutaneous layer) This is a specialised area under the dermis, which contains a network of collagen fibres and fat cells (adipocytes). It protects the body from external trauma and insulates from cold. It acts as a main storage site for fat and therefore energy. There are many blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves passing through the subcutis. The thickness of the subcutaneous layer varies according to the location on the body and from person to person.

        "What is it?": "Also known as…Acrochordons Skin tags are harmless growths that hang from the surface of your skin. They range in size from 1mm to 1cm and are made of collagen fibres and blood vessels surrounded by skin. Skin tags tend to form in places where skin rubs together. They are commonly found on the eyelids, neck, armpits, under the breasts, or in the groin. ",
        "What causes it?": "The exact cause of skin tags is unknown, however the following factors are involved: ",
        "Who gets it?": "Skin tags are very common and occur in approximately 50% of adults. They occur in both men and women as they grow older. They are more likely to affect people who are overweight or people who are diabetic, however some people develop them for no apparent reason. There is often a family history of skin tags. ",

        "How is it treated?": "There is usually no reason to treat skin tags. They can be removed for cosmetic reasons, or may be removed if they frequently snag on clothing or jewellery. However, once skin tags are removed, it is not unusual to form a new skin tag in the same area. The following methods may be suggested by your dermatologist: Skin tags can bleed once they are removed, so never try to pull or cut a skin tag on your own. ",

        "Erythema Infectiosum": "Also known as…Parvovirus B19 Infection, Fifth Disease or “Slapped Cheek” Disease What is Erythema Infectiosum? Erythema Infectiosum is usually a harmless childhood viral infection characterised by a classic slapped-cheek appearance or a lacy patterned rash. The infection can be associated with fevers. Human parvovirus B19 is a member of the family Parvoviridae. The time from contact to clinical signs and symptoms varies between 4 and 14 days. Transmission is via respiratory secretions, blood products and from a pregnant woman to her foetus. Approximately 75% of cases occur in children aged 5 to15 years but any age group can be affected. Worldwide epidemics of the infection tend to occur in late winter or early spring. One infection gives lifelong immunity. The infection is so common that more than 50% of all adults have been infected by the age of 20. Up to half of those who contract the condition have no signs or symptoms. Mild symptoms such as low-grade fever, muscle aches and headache may occur 7 to10 days before the characteristic rash appears. Rose-red spots on the cheeks rapidly come together to form a hot, red, sunburn-like or “slapped-cheek” appearance. Usually, the rash does not affect the areas around the nose, eyes and mouth. A red bumpy rash may occur 1 to 4 days later on the extremities and to a lesser extent on the trunk. This progresses to a lacy, reticulated pattern. Sometimes spots may appear in the mouth. The rash typically lasts between 1 and 3 weeks. It may recur with exercise, irritation, stress or the skin overheating from sun exposure or bathing in hot water. In adults, especially women, polyarthralgia (multiple inflamed joints) is often the main symptom of infection. Small joints of the hands as well as wrists, knees and ankles are most commonly affected. Joint pain may be present without an accompanying rash. Acute cases are associated with a distinctive syndrome called “papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome”. This is characterised by swelling and redness of palms and soles in association with pinpoint purple spots. Erythema Infectiosum can cause a much more serious infection and trigger a range of complications in high-risk groups: Other conditions associated with or triggered by the condition include: The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical appearance of the rash alone. Blood tests may be needed in cases of doubt or when a pregnant woman has been exposed to the infection. The classic childhood form of the condition is self-limiting which means that it resolves spontaneously without complications. There is no specific treatment. Affected children may remain at school as the infectious stage occurs before the rash is evident. Often the only intervention needed is to reassure parents of affected children. It is important that everyone in the same household washes their hands frequently to reduce the chances of the infection spreading. Symptoms can be relieved by: Pregnant women who may have come into contact with people in the incubation stage or in aplastic crisis should be referred for obstetric follow-up care for possible serologic testing and close foetal monitoring. Individuals predisposed to aplastic crisis require hospitalisation and are likely to need transfusion and/or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. There is no vaccination to prevent the infection.

        "Naevus spilus": "Also known as speckled lentiginous naevus, zosteriform lentiginous naevus What is naevus spilus? Naevus spilus is a type of birthmark that consists of a flat brown background patch containing darker brown spots or tiny bumps. What causes it? Naevus spilus is caused by a localised defect in melanoblasts (the forerunners of pigment cells) that populate a particular area of the skin. There is some controversy as to whether naevus spilus represents a birthmark known as a variant of a congenital melanocytic naevus, or it is acquired later on in life. What does it look like? A variable number of black, brown or red-brown spots or tiny lumps are seen within a flat patch of tan-to-brown hyperpigmentation. The “background” tan patch is usually noted at birth, or soon after, while the spots within the patch appear over time. Any site of the body might be affected. The spots or bumps within the background stain are usually moles called pigmented naevi. There are many types of these including junctional, compound and intradermal naevi, Spitz and blue naevi. There are reports of cutaneous melanoma arising within a naevus spilus but this is extremely rare. How is naevus spilus diagnosed? Diagnosis is by visual inspection. A skin biopsy will be needed if atypical features are present or there is a history of recent change. How is naevus spilus treated? Initially, naevus spilus should be photographed to document stability of the lesions. A biopsy will be needed for any suspicious areas. Affected individuals should check the area as part of their regular full body self-examination and note any changes. Laser treatment may be considered when the appearance of the naevus is of cosmetic concern. Both the Q-switched ruby and Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers have been used to treat the background hyperpigmentation and the speckles of naevus spilus. However, results are variable – some lesions respond well while others do not. Regular self-examination is still necessary, even after successful treatment. You should seek medical advice for any unusual or new changes in appearance.

        "Spider naevi": "Also known as spider naevus, spider angioma, nevus araneus What are spider naevi? Spider naevi are prominent blood vessels affecting up to 10% of the population. They usually occur as single or multiple blood vessels on the face, chest and neck areas. As the name suggests, spider naevi look like central red lumps with blood vessels radiating in a spider web-like pattern from the centre. Spider naevi are readily and safely treated with vascular lasers. What causes spider naevi? It is not known why most spider naevi occur. However, growth factors such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factors) are known to play a role in the occurrence of vascular lesions. In certain cases, the occurrence of spider naevi can be caused by: What do they look like? Spider naevi, as the name suggests, are red pin-point blood vessels measuring 1 to 3 mm in diameter which  have a feeding blood vessel in the centre with smaller vessels radiating outwards in a spider web-like pattern. Spider naevi usually occur as single or multiple blood vessels on the cheeks, nose and neck areas. Application of pressure to the centre of the blood vessel causes temporary improvement. Release of pressure causes rapid re-filling of the vessels.   In some cases multiple spider naevi are seen on the chest and shoulder areas during pregnancy. Spider naevi may develop in both adults and children. How is spider naevi diagnosed? Formal tests are not usually required. However, spider naevi occurring in the mouth or on the lips may require further testing. How are they treated? Unless a child feels self-conscious about the appearance of the condition, treatment of spider naevi in children is usually unnecessary. In certain cases, the condition will resolve with age.  However, if naevi are persistent, most children over the age of 8 will tolerate treatment with a vascular laser. Spider naevi associated with pregnancy may fade within 2 to 6 months postpartum (after giving birth). Laser treatment is considered the gold standard in treating spider naevi and many different types of laser treatments are available. One to two pulses will usually resolve up to 90% of spots. For deeper spider naevi, or for people with darker skin types, longer pulse lasers can be considered. This information has been written by Dr Davin S.

        "Telangiectases": "Also known as … Spider Veins, Angioectasias, Broken Blood Vessels or Capillaries What are telangiectases? Telangiectases are superficial blood vessels, which are visible with the naked eye. The majority can be improved with laser treatment or sclerotherapy. They are caused by dilated blood vessels under the surface of the skin or in mucous membranes. These spots may occur spontaneously or as a result of various underlying medical conditions or procedures (see list below). They are small, blanchable red spots between 0.5 to 1mm in diameter, which are visible to the naked eye. They occur on various parts of the body or mucous membranes depending on the underlying cause. The most commonly affected areas are the nose, cheeks, chin and legs. They often occur in isolation and are not associated with primary cutaneous disorders. Some secondary causes include: Physical associated telangiectases as a result of: Blood vessels secondary to primary condition in: Conditions associated with telangiectases include: Investigations are not always necessary as telangiectases are diagnosed from their typical appearance. However, if an underlying medical cause is suspected the dermatologist will determine if further investigations such as skin biopsies, imaging or blood tests are needed. Treatment is necessary only if the lesions cause symptoms or if they are a cosmetic concern. Specific treatments include: Colour matched makeup is an excellent method of covering up redness associated with telangiectases. Green-tinted foundations and creams are especially helpful in concealing redness. Laser therapy is an effective method for treating facial telangiectases. The correct types of lasers are readily available in many dermatologist practices. Lunchtime procedures can be organised depending on the extent of the area being treated. IPL can be very effective in treating small to medium-sized facial telangiectases. Larger telangiectases respond better to longer wavelength lasers. Fine needle hyfrector may be used but there are more side effects than with laser therapy. They are harmless and the vast majority of cases are not associated with an underlying medical condition. Laser treatment, when performed by a dermatologist, often removes these spots safely and effectively.

It starts from cells in the outermost layer of the skin which start to overgrow and potentially spread. SCC can also start from cells on the lips, tongue, lining of the mouth and genitals. ",
        "Who gets squamous cell carcinoma?": "SCC occurs mainly in Caucasians. Individuals who are immunosuppressed such as those who have had an organ transplant or those with conditions such as lymphoma are more prone to developing multiple SCCs. SCC usually occurs in older individuals and is very rare in children and young adults. ",
        "What causes squamous cell carcinoma?": "SCC is caused mainly by chronic sun exposure. It is thought that the ultraviolet light, particularly UVA, from the sun gradually triggers the skin cells to develop into a SCC. This means that most SCCs occur on sun-exposed sites. Sometimes a wart virus can trigger changes in the cells causing a SCC to form, especially on the genitals or inside the mouth. Other cases are caused by exposure to chemicals (such as arsenic or the tar found in cigarette smoke) or due to trauma such as a burn. ",
        "What does squamous cell carcinoma look like?": "SCC can present in many different ways. It often presents as a raised scaly lump on sun-exposed sites commonly found on the backs of the hands, forearms, legs, scalp, ears and lips. SCC can also appear as a crusted sore. On the lips an SCC can present as a persistent small ulcer or thickened firm scaly skin. SCC can develop slowly over years from a red scaly sunspot that slowly thickens and enlarges, to become an intraepidermal carcinoma (Bowen’s disease) which is SCC in the thin top layer of the skin. This may progress further to become a fully developed SCC involving the deeper layers of the skin. SCC can also develop rapidly with the changes occurring over a few months.

SCC on the elbow – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Brad Jones Figure 4. SCC on the forearm – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Brad Jones ",
        "How is squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made clinically based on the appearance or behaviour of the SCC. A small biopsy is often needed to confirm the diagnosis prior to treatment being undertaken. The biopsy helps avoid unnecessary surgery on a benign lesion that may mimic SCC and also determines the type of SCC and subsequent treatment method. ",
        "How is squamous cell carcinoma treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. The condition is usually treated with simple skin surgery. This enables the pathologist to check under the microscope that the SCC has been removed completely. Further surgery or radiation therapy may be required if there was any residual tumour evident, or nerves were involved, or a more aggressive pattern was seen under the microscope. In some situations and locations, small SCCs can be treated by a scraping called curettage or by freezing with liquid nitrogen. In cases, where surgery is not appropriate the SCC may be treated by radiation therapy alone. Regular follow-up for monitoring is required. Cemiplimab (immunotherapy agent) is often used by oncologists for metastatic or locally aggressive SCC. Evidence shows that taking a daily Vitamin B3 tablet (nicotinamide) may help lower the incidence of SCCs in high risk individuals. 1 ",
        "What is the likely outcome of squamous cell carcinoma?": "Most SCCs can be easily treated and do not cause any future concerns.

Bowen’s disease can also occur on areas such as the lips, inside the mouth and the genital area. In these cases, it may look like an ulcer or thickened scar. Bowen’s disease often causes no symptoms and hence there is delay in seeking treatment.

        "Steatocystoma Multiplex": "Also known as …  sebocystomastosis Steatocystoma multiplex is a genetic condition. It leads to the development of multiple lumps within the skin called sebaceous cysts. Within the skin, the role of the sebaceous glands is to produce sebum which acts as a lubricant. Sebaceous cysts are small sacs with sebaceous gland lobules in their walls. The cause of steatocystoma multiplex is genetic. It is thought to be a failure of the sebaceous glands to connect to the surface of the skin. The gene implicated is called KRT17. This gene is involved in the production of keratin 17, a protein in sebaceous glands. This gene is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, which means that only one parent needs to have the gene for the offspring to inherit it. Sometimes, there is no obvious family history in patients with steatocystoma multiplex. It may occur in association with othergenetic syndromes like eruptive vellus hair cysts and pachyonychia congenita. Steatocystoma multiplex appears as multiple papules and nodules (bumps) in the skin. Theyare smooth and compressible. The colour varies between skin-coloured and yellowish. Theirsize varies from a few millimetres to a few centimetres. They often affect the chest and upperarms and legs, but can appear on toes, fingers, and face. They often appear around puberty. They are usually asymptomatic (they do not cause any problems). They can become inflamed and heal with scarring. The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist, often through punch biopsy. Due to the number of cysts, the condition is difficult to treat by excision (cutting them out). Retinoids may reduce the size of the current cysts and reduce the rate of new ones forming. Sometimes antibiotics can be used to reduce inflammation. Alternative methods include ablative lasers to destroy the cysts.

If the lip area is affected, the lip line is classically spared. The overlying skin may be red, dry and flaky. This condition is more common in women than men. Children can also be affected. Perioral dermatitis may be symptomless however burning, tightness and itchiness are common. Perioral dermatitis frequently starts off from an unrelated rash or skin irritation. Topical creams, most often corticosteroid and over the counter preparations, are then used. This leads to an outbreak of perioral dermatitis which then seems to be less red with further steroid usage. Ceasing topical steroids generally leads to a flare-up which then encourages further steroid use. Hence a vicious cycle of steroid use is set up. How is it diagnosed? No tests are usually necessary.  Most cases of perioral dermatitis can be diagnosed from a history and examination. In resistant cases, allergic contact dermatitis should be considered and investigated through targeted patch testing. Consider specialist referral. How is it treated? If steroid cream use is suspected, stop using the cream altogether. A rebound or flare-up of perioral dermatitis is to be expected after you stop using the cream, however do not be tempted to re-use the steroid cream again.  If steroid nasal sprays or inhalers are suspected, try rinsing the face and mouth after use. Simplify all skin care. Use soap substitutes and gentle skin care products. If possible, keep make-up use to a minimum. Oral antibiotics are the most effective treatment. They are effective through anti-inflammatory mechanisms and not through their anti-microbial actions.  Usually a 6 week course is prescribed. An additional 6 week course may be considered if the rash recurs. Tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics are most frequently used, including doxycycline, minocycline and erythromycin (the only option in children whose teeth have not formed). Topical medications are not as effective as oral medications.  Examples include erythromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole and azelaic acid.  These may be preferred in pregnancy. Topical pimecrolimus has also been used however this medication has occasionally been reported to be the trigger for perioral dermatitis and should be used with caution. Erythromycin suspension for 4 to 8 weeks is recommended in the treatment of children under the age of 8. What is the likely outcome of perioral dermatitis? Perioral dermatitis carries an excellent prognosis and recurrences are rare providing initiating factors are avoided. Most individuals will start to improve within a few weeks of treatment. If perioral dermatitis recurs, a further 6 week course of antibiotics is recommended. The use of a simplified skin care regime, coupled with avoidance of topical corticosteroids and heavy make-up can prevent recurrences. Consider referral to a dermatologist for resistant cases. Prevention, by avoiding strong topical corticosteroids on the face, is the best option. This information has been written by Dr Davin S.

        "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and (Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)": "What are TEN and SJS? Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are extremely rare, sudden onset, often life-threatening reactions to medications occurring in the skin and the linings of the mouth, the gastrointestinal tract, genitalia and eyes. The affected person has a fever and there may be enlargement of the lymph nodes and inflammation in the liver and other organ systems. SJS is a less severe manifestation involving mainly the lips, eyes and genital mucosa. In TEN large areas of skin are killed by the immune reaction precipitated by the drug, leading to severe pain and loss of skin similar to that seen in burns. In SJS less than 10% of the skin is affected. In TEN more than 30% of the skin is involved. People with 10-30% skin loss are classified as “overlap”. What causes Toxic epidermal necrolysis? TEN is more frequently seen in people who have a specific genetic make-up (genotype) that leads to slow metabolising of certain classes of drugs, or those who have HIV or are immune suppressed. Various medications have been associated with the development of SJS and TEN. In SJS a drug can be incriminated in 50% of cases. In TEN drugs are involved in 95% of cases. They are mostly systemic drugs (oral or injection forms) but some cases have come from topical use as well. Commonly associated medications include antibiotics (sulphonamides), antifungals, antivirals, allopurinol (gout medication), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants. The onset of the adverse drug reaction usually occurs within 7 to 21 days of commencing treatment. What does TEN look like? Flu-like symptoms such as generalised aches and pains, sore throat and runny nose often precede the rash. TEN develops as a flat, tender, red rash that starts on the face and trunk and rapidly spreads to the rest of the body, including mucous membranes (linings of mouth, guts, wind pipes, eyes and genitals). The size of the rash expands and often forms blisters. A gentle touch or rub can peel the skin off and it is very painful. The condition often spreads over hours to days. The active phase can last up to two weeks. How is TEN diagnosed? There is no specific laboratory test needed to diagnose TEN or SJS. The history of the development of the rash and a physical examination usually suggest the diagnosis. A skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or other blistering diseases. Blood tests are often required to assess the fluid/nutritional status and to identify complications. What other problems can occur with TEN? As the skin is the physical barrier protecting the body against infections and keeping water inside the body, the loss of the top layer of skin in TEN and SJS leads to severe problems of dehydration and increases the risk of infection. Infections are a common cause of death in those affected with TEN.  In the short term, individuals can also develop dehydration, multiple organ failure and blood clots. How is TEN treated? The first step is to stop the medication. After this, the treatment for TEN and SJS is mainly supportive care until the top layer of skin regenerates. Affected individuals are often transferred to a burns or intensive care unit and treated as if they have suffered from very severe burns. They require life support, fluid and electrolyte replacement and antibiotics to treat infections. Usually, affected individuals are managed in a multidisciplinary team that includes a dermatologist. Specific treatments Some reported cases have benefited from immunoglobulins, immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporin), systemic steroids or other biologic agents. However, evidence of their effectivenes is limited and controversial. What is the likely outcome of TEN? TEN is a life-threatening condition that is associated with high mortality rate. It is estimated to be about 5-12% for SJS and 30% for TEN. In the long term, those who survive from TEN may be left with pigmented and scarred skin, damaged nails and joints, and eye problems. What follow up is needed for TEN? People who develop TEN require follow up to identify the likely cause of the condition to that it can be avoided.  To prevent any recurrence, affected individuals should discuss any new medications with a doctor and a pharmacist prior to commencement to check the similarity of the chemical compounds.

        "Infantile Haemangiomas": "Also known as…Strawberry Birthmarks What are Infantile Haemangiomas? Infantile haemangiomas are the most common benign growths of infancy and childhood, affecting 2.6¬ to 4% of babies by 6 weeks of age. The cause of infantile haemangiomas is not well understood, but the placenta is considered to play a role. Certain risk factors including being female (incidence of females to males is 2:1), prematurity (being born early), low birth weight, vaginal bleeding early in the pregnancy and an amniocentesis (a test carried out in early pregnancy) are thought to play a role. Infantile haemangiomas may look like a patch of white skin with a few visible blood vessels on the surface. In many cases it is not noticed at birth. Within 1 to 3 weeks of birth the blood vessels start to multiply and divide and the haemangioma develops into a bright red strawberry colour. If the blood vessels extend deeper into the skin, there will be the appearance of a bluish swelling underneath the skin. In some cases the haemangioma may present as a bluish swelling only, without the accompanying strawberry coloured overlay. The haemangioma grows rapidly in the first 8 to12 weeks after which it slows and stops growing at 4 to 9 months of age. A dulling of the colour indicates the beginning of the regression phase. The time it takes to improve depends on the size of the haemangioma however most have regressed by 4 to 5 years of age. Despite significant improvement in all cases, the skin may not return to normal, particularly if the haemangioma had been very raised. The skin may be left stretched and wrinkled with some soft fatty tissue and a few surface blood vessels. Infantile haemangiomas which affect large areas of the face can be associated with a range of abnormalities of the brain, heart, major blood vessels and eyes (PHACE syndrome). Large lesions over the lower back and buttocks may be associated with spinal cord and kidney abnormalities (LUMBAR or PELVIS syndrome). Small or focal haemangiomas do not require any further formal testing. Haemangiomas affecting large areas of the face require an MRI/MRA of the brain, eye review and a cardiology review with echocardiography. Large lower back or buttock haemangiomas may require an ultrasound of the spinal cord and genitourinary tract followed up by an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) test. Multiple haemangiomas (more than 5) require an ultrasound of the liver to be performed. Haemangiomas near the eye need to be monitored by a paediatric eye surgeon (ophthalmologist), as partially blocked vision can lead to permanent eye damage. Haemangiomas over the lower cheek or chin and neck (the so-called “beard distribution”) will need to be reviewed by an ear nose and throat (ENT) surgeon as haemangiomas can be associated with airway obstruction. The vast majority of small haemangiomas do not need any form of treatment. Small red haemangiomas on cosmetically important sites can be treated with a topical beta blocker such as timolol 0.5% eye drops. Haemangiomas blocking vision or blocking the airway, ulcerated lesions or rapidly growing lesions on cosmetically important sites can be treated with oral medication such as propranolol. Switching off the growth phase of the haemangioma as soon as possible ensures a better cosmetic result, by reducing the risk of scarring and the need for later surgery. Injected and oral steroids are rarely used. Pulsed dye laser may be needed to clear remaining blood vessels at the conclusion of treatment and prior to the child commencing school.

        "Striae": "Also known as stretch marks, striae rubra (red stretch marks), striae alba (white stretch marks) What is striae? Stretch marks are extremely common, affecting over 70% of the population. There are two types of stretch marks – striae rubra (red or new stretch marks) and striae alba (white or old stretch marks). New stretch marks are more responsive to treatment than old stretch marks. What causes striae? Stretch marks, as the name suggests, are due to stretching of the skin, which results in altered structural support in the deeper layers of the skin. Microscopic studies of stretch marks show alteration in collagen and diminished elastin, as well as dermal oedema (swelling). Early stretch marks exhibit an increase in the number of blood vessels and inflammation, resulting in pink-purple discolouration. What do striae look like? The first signs of stretch marks are pink to purple lines usually running crosswise on the trunk and lengthwise along the limb. Early stretch marks may be itchy. Over time stretch marks lighten and develop a pale, wrinkled appearance known as striae alba. Stretch marks most commonly occur on the abdomen, inner arms, the back and breast areas. Stretch marks may also develop in the groin and armpits if high strength steroid creams are inappropriately used in these areas. What other problems can occur with striae? How are striae diagnosed? Stretch marks most often occur in otherwise normal individuals and no investigations are needed to make a diagnosis. Stretch marks may occur in people who have Cushing’s, Marfan’s or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Investigations are determined from clinical examination. How is striae treated? Stretch marks are a cosmetic problem and treatment is optional. The majority of stretch marks will fade over time. Early red stretch marks respond better to treatment than older, white stretch marks. No treatment will remove stretch marks completely. Treatment of red stretch marks Treatment of white stretch marks White stretch marks can be very difficult to treat. Expect only a mild to modest improvement with multiple sessions. Treatment methods include: What is the likely outcome of striae? The majority of stretch marks will improve over time, changing colour from red-purple to pink, then finally achieving a white wrinkled appearance. Treating early stretch marks with laser treatment combined with vitamin A creams gives the best outcome.

        "Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn": "Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a type of fat inflammation (panniculitis). It is a rare and transient condition that results in the development of red, firm and deep lumps in the fatty layer of the skin. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn typically affects full-term neonates in the first 2-3 weeks of life. The prognosis is generally favourable and treatment unnecessary. Subcutaneous fat necrosis mainly affects the brown fat in neonates. Brown fat is a type of fat that helps to generate heat under cold conditions. Triggers of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn may include: However, most babies who are exposed to these triggers do not get subcutaneous fat necrosis. The rash usually looks like red, firm and deep lumps or large areas of raised skin. The cheek, shoulders, back, buttocks and thighs are the most commonly affected body sites. The most important complication of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is high calcium levels (hypercalcemia). This may develop either during the acute phases of the condition or delayed for up to months later. Hypercalcemia may be completely asymptomatic or be associated with fevers, irritability, vomiting, seizures, increased urination, vomiting, kidney problems and even death if severe. Other problems that rarely may occur include: The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist. A skin biopsy may be taken to confirm the diagnosis, which would show inflammation of the fat in a pattern called “lobular panniculitis”. The condition tends to resolve spontaneously within 6 weeks without treatment. If severe, systemic steroids can be used to control the inflammation. Longitudinal monitoring of calcium levels (for at least 4 months) is recommended. The prognosis of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is overall favourable. Rarely, some lesions may end up shrunken-looking (atrophic) or slightly pigmented. As mentioned, hypercalcemia needs to be monitored even after the disappearance of the skin lesions.

        "What is sun protection?": "Sun protection is aimed at reducing excessive exposure to sunlight. Effective sun protection allows for healthy growth and development as well as enjoyment of outdoor activities but, at the same time, aims to reduce risk of skin diseases and ageing which are related to overexposure to sunlight. Effective sun protection includes: ",
        "Why is sun protection important?": "Australia has a very high incidence of skin cancer, both melanoma and non-melanoma, due to everyday sun exposure particularly amongst Australians of Celtic ancestry with fair skin and blue eyes. Sun exposure over time produces premature ageing changes in the skin of all ethnic groups. Consequently, daily sun protection should be used in Australia and New Zealand, particularly during the spring and summer months, where the UV index is often 3 or higher for nearly the entire day. The amount of cloud cover, or temperature, is not a good guide as to how much ultraviolet radiation is reaching our skin and damaging it. ",
        "What is ultraviolet energy?": "Ultraviolet radiation is energy produced by the sun which is divided into 3 types according to its wavelength – UVB, UVA and UVC. Both UVA and UVB radiation contribute to: ",
        "What are sunscreens?": "Sunscreens are products (creams, lotions, mists, sprays, gels) applied to the skin to reduce the effect of ultraviolet radiation on the skin. Sunscreens help prevent the development of skin cancer including melanoma. They also help prevent the development and symptoms of photo-sensitising disorders such as photoallergies and phototoxicities. Regular use of sunscreens can help prevent the photodamaging and ageing effects of the sun on the skin. Sunscreens should be used in conjunction with physical protection and should not be seen as a substitute for physical protection. Avoiding sun exposure, seeking shade and wearing protective clothing (hat, sunglasses, long sleeves) offer the best protection. ",
        "How do sunscreens work?": "Sunscreens work in 2 ways: Reflectant sunscreens block UV away from the skin and include zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. How well this is done is dependent on the amount of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that is applied to the skin. The skin may take on a milky-white appearance when the product is applied although newer formulas have improved this appearance. Absorbent sunscreen agents absorb UVB or UVA radiation. Most absorbent sunscreens contain a mixture of the following synthetic chemicals – cinnamates, dibenzoylmethanes (salicylates) and benzophenones. Absorbent sunscreens are usually invisible when applied to the skin. Sunscreen ingredients are mixed in different bases to provide a large variety of available products (creams, lotions, gels, sprays and lip balms). The bases for sunscreens also contain other chemical additives necessary to ensure stability, adequate mixing, a pleasant feel on the skin, a pleasant odour and adequate anti-microbial activity. No sunscreen will block 100% of UV radiation – there is always some UV that reaches the skin even when the sunscreen has been applied correctly. ",
        "What does SPF mean?": "SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor. SPF indicates the amount of UVB radiation that can reach the skin with sunscreen compared with no sunscreen. It is calculated knowing how much UVB radiation is necessary to create redness (burn) of the skin. If you wore SPF 50+, for example, you could stay in the sun 50 times longer before burning compared to if you were wearing no sunscreen at all. The SPF is determined in scientific laboratory conditions and is regulated in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to ensure strict labelling and safety for consumers. It is important to realise that you cannot depend on the SPF to determine how long you can stay exposed to sunlight or how long before you get sunburnt. In real life the actual SPF of a product is often lower than the formal laboratory testing. All sunscreens, even when applied correctly, will still allow some UV to penetrate the skin. SPF is the measurement of protection against UVB only. Sunscreens with the same SPF can offer different levels of protection against UVA radiation. Therefore, it is important to choose a sunscreen labelled “broad-spectrum” which protects against both UVA and UVB. In addition to the SPF and broad-spectrum factors, sunscreens in Australia are also labelled for water resistance. This represents the ability of the sunscreen to remain effective on the skin after repeated or prolonged exposure to water. No sunscreen is “waterproof” and all sunscreens become less effective to some extent after exposure to water. It is always recommended that sunscreens be reapplied after exposure to water to ensure adequate protection. The Cancer Council recommends Australians use SPF50 or SPF50+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen. ",
        "How should I apply sunscreens?": "It is a known fact that most individuals do not apply adequate amounts of sunscreen, thereby reducing its effectiveness. Sunscreens should be applied liberally and evenly to clean and dry skin at least 20 minutes before exposure to UV. This allows the product to be evenly dispersed and absorbed into the superficial layers of the skin. Most products are not visible when applied to skin and as a result small areas can be missed, leading to sunburn appearing in these areas the next day. Care should be taken when applying sunscreens. It is important not to miss your ears, hands and feet and back of the neck. Apply at least 1 teaspoon of sunscreen product to each body part (face, neck and ears, arm, leg, front of body, back). Sunscreen should always be reapplied at least every 2 hours, irrespective of the water resistance of the sunscreen. Swimming, sport, sweating and towel drying can reduce the effectiveness of the sunscreen, so sunscreen should always be reapplied after these activities. ",
        "What are the common side effects of sunscreens?": "All the synthetic chemicals used in sunscreens have been subjected to extensive testing to determine the risk of side effects. Despite this, problems can occur occasionally with the regular use of sunscreens. The most common side effect is irritation. Burning, stinging or redness can occur in certain areas of the skin more than others after application of the sunscreen. This is particularly on the face around the eyelids, or occasionally on the hairy forearms of men. This is not an allergy to the sunscreen as the effect only occurs in certain areas, whereas it can be used without any problems on other areas of skin. When irritancy occurs, it is recommended to find an alternative sunscreen that does not irritate the skin. A true allergic reaction to a chemical in a sunscreen product can occur but is less common. In most cases it is not the synthetic sunscreen chemical itself that is the problem, but more likely one of the other chemicals used in the base such as a perfume or preservative. Professional assessment and patch testing may be useful in identifying the product in the sunscreen that is causing the allergic reaction. Some sunscreens can cause acne-like eruptions (pimples, folliculitis) when applied to the skin. Again, this is usually caused by the base ingredients of the sunscreen. If you are prone to this problem, it is best to look for gels or lotions or products labelled “oil-free” or “non-comedogenic”. There are very few reports of chronic or long-term problems related to the regular use of sunscreen. In case of doubt, avoiding the sun by keeping in the shade and/or wearing protective clothing are the best options. ",
        "Do sunscreens cause cancer?": "To date, there is no scientific evidence to support the claims that synthetic sunscreen chemicals are carcinogenic or have cancer-causing potential. Despite multiple publications about “nano” particles in magazines and newspapers, no adverse effect of “nano” particles in sunscreens have been demonstrated to date. Because skin cancer and melanoma have been linked to sunlight and solarium UV exposure, the benefits of sun protection are clear. ",
        "Are sunscreens safe for young babies?": "Because very young babies (less than six months of age) absorb more of any chemical applied to the skin than adults, the widespread regular use of chemical sunscreens is not recommended. However, there have been no reports of side-effects occurring as a result of sunscreen absorption in babies to date. ",
        "Can I become deficient in vitamin D if I protect with sunscreen?": "In theory yes, but most individuals are not using sunscreens as they should, that is they often do not apply enough product to the skin and reapply as often as recommended. Individuals that are protecting themselves very well because of a history of skin cancer or melanoma, should talk to their doctor about vitamin D deficiency. Remember sunscreens are only one form of sun protection and cannot be fully relied on to prevent sun damage and skin cancers. Whenever the UV index is 3 or above, all five forms of sun protection should be followed: Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "What are actinic keratoses?": "Actinic keratoses are pre-cancerous lesions that develop on sun-exposed areas of skin. They most commonly appear as rough, dry and scaly patches on the skin. Some actinic keratoses may develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ",
        "Who gets actinic keratoses?": "Some individuals are more at risk in developing actinic keratoses, such as: ",
        "What causes actinic keratoses?": "Too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun cause nearly all actinic keratoses. UV radiation penetrates the upper layers of the skin and can cause changes to its structure and appearance. Repeated UV exposure can also damage some of the genetic material (DNA) in skin cells causing chemical changes and mutations. It also impairs the skin’s immune system and its ability to repair any damage. ",
        "What do actinic keratoses look like?": "The appearance of actinic keratoses can vary: Actinic keratoses can occur as a single, isolated lesion, but there are more often multiple. They are commonly found on areas of the body that are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, forearms, backs of hands and lower legs. They may be asymptomatic, itchy or sensitive to touch. Actinic keratoses can also affect the lips and this is known as actinic cheilitis. Figure 1. Actinic keratoses on the face – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Michelle Hunt Figure 2. Actinic keratoses on the hand – Image reproduced with permission of Dr Michelle Hunt ",
        "How are actinic keratoses diagnosed?": "Actinic keratoses are usually diagnosed clinically from their physical appearance. In some cases, dermoscopy may be useful in diagnosing actinic keratoses. However, in cases of doubt, or if progression to SCC is suspected, a skin sample (biopsy) may be necessary. ",
        "How are actinic keratoses treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs, and whether it is a single keratosis or multiple keratoses being treated. Actinic keratoses treatment is aimed at preventing the lesions from turning into skin cancers, and improving the appearance and texture of the skin. There are many treatment options available, such as: Pretreatment with keratolytics such as salicylic acid or topical retinoid creams may be used to help improve sun damaged skin and improve response to treatment. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of actinic keratoses?": "Most actinic keratoses can be treated and cured. If they are found and treated early, they may not develop into skin cancer. In some cases, actinic keratoses may recur months or years after treatment, and new ones are likely to develop. They are also associated with an increased risk of developing skin cancers, particularly SCC. It is important that a combination of sun protection measures are used, including the wearing of sun protective clothing, correct use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen, wearing of a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses to reduce the risk of developing new actinic keratoses. Oral Vitamin B3 may also reduce the number and severity of actinic keratoses. Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists. You may use for personal use only."

        "Erythema Annulare Centrifugum": "Also known as … Superficial or Deep Gyrate Erythema, Erythema Perstans, Palpable Migrating Erythema What is Erythema Annulare Centrifugum? Erythema Annulare Centrifugum (EAC) refers to an annular (ring-shaped) erythematous (red) skin eruption that tends to spread outwards whilst clearing centrally. The cause of EAC is unknown but it is probably due to a hypersensitivity reaction to a variety of agents including drugs, insect or spider bites, infections (bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal), food ingestion (such as blue cheese), malignancies or some underlying diseases. In most cases no cause will be found for the EAC. Some people with EAC may have no symptoms whilst others experience mild itching associated with the rash. EAC usually begins as a small raised pink-red spot that slowly enlarges forming a ring shape while the central area flattens and clears. There may be an inner rim of scale. Sometimes the lesions do not form complete rings but grow into irregular shapes. As lesions resolve, there is no residual scarring but the skin may temporarily become redder. One or several lesions of EAC may be localised to one area of the body or generalised over many areas. Lesions most often appear on the thighs and legs. They may occur anywhere on the body but typically spare the palms and soles. The diagnosis of EAC is made by clinical examination. Further investigations may be needed to exclude other causes of annular rashes and to look for an underlying cause. In some cases a skin scraping is needed to exclude fungal infections that may mimic EAC. A biopsy of the skin may be needed in some cases. EAC is usually self-limited which means that it usually resolves without treatment. However, eruptions may last from a few weeks to many years. EAC has been known to resolve once the underlying diseases has been treated. The prognosis for EAC is excellent except in rare cases when it is associated with an underlying cancer or disease.

The aim of treatment is to: Some general measures, include: Topical prescription medicines are rarely needed, but may include corticosteroids and analgesics. In severe cases, oral medications may be used, such as: Biologic agents such as adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab have also been reported to help as well as the oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor apremilast in severe resistant cases. The use of laser, such as CO2 and Nd:YAG may also improve symptoms. ",

        "Miliaria": "Also known as heat rash, prickly heat or sweat rash What is miliaria? Miliaria is a group of skin conditions that arise from blockage of sweat ducts. There are three types of miliaria classified by the level of blockage of the sweat duct. These include miliaria crystalline, miliaria rubra and miliaria profunda. Who develops miliaria? Miliaria appears in about 15% of newborns. Babies are more commonly affected than children or adults as their sweat ducts are not yet fully developed. Adults may also be affected, particularly those who work in humid and hot conditions. What causes miliaria? Miliaria is caused by obstruction of sweat ducts, often from heat and excess sweating. Common situations in which blockage of the sweat ducts occurs include: No known diseases are associated with miliaria. What does miliaria look like? Miliaria commonly appears in areas of skin that have been blocked particularly around the neck and upper trunk in both children and adults. Other areas that can be affected include the groin, waistline, under the breasts, skin folds and armpits. Unlike acne, miliaria does not arise around hair follicles. Miliaria crystallina appears as small, superficial and clear blisters. These break easily from mild friction or bathing. Miliaria rubra appears as small, red flat or bumpy spots that are usually itchy. In chronic and recurrent cases, the lesions can turn into pus-filled spots. Miliaria profunda appears as deep red or white lumps that are prickly. These lesions are generally not itchy as they appear below the itch receptors. How is miliaria diagnosed? Miliaria is most often diagnosed based on the typical appearance of the lesions. The doctor may perform a simple diagnostic test where a fine needle is used to rupture the blister so that the clear fluid/sweat can be assessed. A biopsy of the skin may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish it from other conditions that look similar (e.g. erythema toxicum neonatorum, neonatal cephalic pustulosis, candidiasis, Grover’s disease). The doctor may also request a skin swab to rule out secondary infection. Individuals who develop heat stress syndrome may need to have blood tests. What other problems can occur with miliaria? Miliaria spots can become infected and form abscesses (pus-filled lumps). In addition, when a large surface area of the body is affected, affected individuals can develop a high temperature and suffer from heat stress syndrome. How is miliaria treated? Miliaria usually disappears after the body is cooled down. It is best prevented by avoiding overheating and over swaddling. More severe cases (e.g. miliaria profunda) can take several weeks to resolve as time is required for the plugs that block the opening of sweat ducts to be pushed outward by new sweat duct cells. General measures recommended to improve symptoms: Soothing lotions (e.g. calamine lotion) or topical steroids may help to relieve symptoms. Antiseptics and antibiotics may be recommended if a secondary infection is suspected. What is the likely outcome of miliaria? Miliaria usually disappears without any significant complications once the affected person is placed in a cool and ventilated environment. In rare cases where a person suffers from chronic and recurrent miliaria rubra or profunda, a large number of sweat glands may end up not functioning properly. This can lead to compensatory facial sweating. Individuals who develop secondary infection or heat stress syndrome need appropriate follow-up by the doctor.

        "Plantar hyperhidrosis": "Also known as sweaty feet What is plantar hyperhidrosis? Plantar hyperhidrosis is a common condition affecting 1-3% of the population. The condition usually starts in childhood or adolescence.  It can cause significant physical limitations and predispose to bacterial and fungal infections and friction blisters. What causes plantar hyperhidrosis? Many factors can contribute to plantar hyperhidrosis including genetic influences, as well as physical and emotional stress. A family history is present in up to 30% of cases. What does plantar hyperhidrosis look like? Plantar hyperhidrosis affects both feet equally. The condition can range from mild sweating through to severe constant sweating, but which stops when asleep. What other problems can occur with palmar hyperhidrosis? Plantar hyperhidrosis can occur on its own or in combination with other conditions. Severe cases can lead to infections such as tinea pedis, pitted keratolysis and other bacterial infections. The condition can be very distressing due to its impact on quality of life. Plantar hyperhidrosis can also be associated with increased sweating in other parts of the body including underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis), face and scalp (craniofacial hyperhidrosis). How is plantar hyperhidrosis diagnosed? Most cases are not associated with an underlying illness. The diagnosis is usually made based on a history of excessive sweating. No investigations are needed. When there is evidence of tinea or bacterial infection a skin scraping and bacterial swab may be needed. Depending on the results, an anti-fungal or antibiotic cream or tablet may be recommended. Further investigations are considered when excessive sweating affects larger areas of the body or if hyperhidrosis occurs during sleep. How is plantar hyperhidrosis treated? The use of absorbent inner soles (summer soles) can help preserve your shoes. Double layered white cotton socks can help soak up excessive sweating. Changing socks frequently can help reduce the incidence of infections. The use of talc and powders can also help absorb excessive sweating. Shoe driers can help increase the lifespan of your shoes. Mild cases of plantar hyperhidrosis can respond to topical treatments such as aluminium chloride hexahydrate (Driclor). Driclor should always be applied to skin that is as dry as possible in order to maximise the benefit and minimise potential side effects. Ideally, it should be applied just after a shower prior to bedtime. Dry the area off with a hairdryer on the cool setting then apply Driclor. Rinse your feet first thing in the morning with plain water (no soap). If irritation develops, applying a corticosteroid cream on alternate days can be useful (this needs to used be under the guidance of a health professional). Anticholinergic creams such as glycopyrolate (0.5-3%) may be effective in managing plantar hyperhidrosis. A compounding pharmacist can make up these creams. The skin will absorb more cream if a foot scrub is used first. Iontophoresis may be considered for cases which do not respond to topical treatments. Treatments are individualised. The affected area is immersed in tap water, salty water or glycopyrrolate solution. Then a gentle electric current is passed across the skin surface for 10 to 20 minutes. Glycopyrrolate iontophoresis has the highest success rate – up to 80% of affected people respond well to this treatment. The time between treatments will vary. Treatments will need to be repeated every 2 to14 days. Botox injections can treat sweaty feet safely and effectively. However, the treatment is not subsidised under Medicare-PBS and the cost limits its wider use. Botox treatment is usually performed under a nerve block. The amount of botox needed depends on the size of the feet. Usually 130 to 200 units of botox are needed in each foot. The treatment is usually effective for 3 to 4 months. Side effects include temporary muscle weakness. Anticholinergic tablets (such as oxybutynin and propantheline bromide) can be useful for plantar hyperhidrosos. However, side effects such as blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth and excessive drowsiness are common. Other medications reported to be useful include oral glycopyrrolate (not available in Australia), propranolol, clonazepam and gabapentin. Medication can be a viable short-term option for treating sweaty feet for several days to weeks and give people a “break” from their sweating. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy is not a treatment option for plantar hyperhidrosis. What is the likely outcome of plantar hyperhidrosis? Plantar hyperhidrosis will often need ongoing and persistent treatment. However, some people may notice the amount of sweating decreases as they get older.

        "Palmar hyperhidrosis": "Also known as sweaty hands What is palmar hyperhidrosis? Palmar hyperhidrosis, or excessive hand sweating, is a common condition affecting 1-3% of the population. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence. Sweaty hands can significantly affect a person socially and emotionally. What causes palmar hyperhidrosis? Many factors can contribute to the condition, including genetic influences as well as physical and emotional stress. A family history is present in up to 30% of cases. What does palmar hyperhidrosis look like? Palmar hyperhidrosis affects both hands equally and can range from mild clammy hands to severe sweating. It stops when sleep. What other problems can occur with palmar hyperhidrosis? Most cases are not associated with an underlying illness. Sweaty hands can be associated with increased sweating in other parts of the body including underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis), face and scalp (craniofacial hyperhidrosis) and feet (plantar hyperhidrosis). The condition can be very distressing due to its impact on quality of life. How is palmer hyperhidrosis diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually made based on a history of excessive sweating. No investigations are needed. Further investigations are considered when larger areas of the body are affected or if hyperhidrosis occurs during sleep. How is it palmer hyperhidrosis treated? Treatment will depend on how severe the sweating is and which previous treatments have been successful. Some mild to moderate cases can respond to topical treatments such as aluminium chloride hexahydrate (Driclor). Driclor should always be applied to skin that is as dry as possible in order to maximise the benefit and minimise potential side effects. Ideally, it should be applied just after a shower prior to bedtime. Dry the area off with a hairdryer on the cool setting then apply Driclor. Wash your hands first thing in the morning with plain water (no soap). If irritation develops, applying a corticosteroid cream intermittently can be useful (this needs to used be under the guidance of a health professional). Anticholinergic creams such as glycopyrolate (0.5-3%) can also be effective. A compounding pharmacist can make up these creams. Side effects are uncommon.

Other medications reported to be useful include oral glycopyrrolate (not available in Australia), propranolol, clonazepam and gabapentin. Medications can be a viable short-term option for several days to weeks and give people a “break” from their sweating. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is a surgical treatment option for various forms of hyperhidrosis. It is conducted by a vascular or neurosurgeon under general anaesthesia. It has a very high success rate for treating palmar hyperhidrosis but carries a significant risk of compensatory or “rebound” sweating. Compensatory sweating occurs in areas such as the back or lower limbs weeks to months after ETS surgery. Compensatory hyperhidrosis can be difficult to treat and usually persists for life. An in-depth discussion with your vascular surgeon or neurologist is needed prior to considering ETS surgery. What is the likely outcome of palmar hyperhidrosis? Palmar hyperhidrosis will often need ongoing and persistent treatment. However, some people may notice the amount of sweating decreases as they get older.

        "Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis": "Also known as … Atopic Winter Feet, Forefoot Dermatitis, Moon-boot Foot Syndrome, Sweaty Sock Dermatitis What is Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis? Juvenile Plantar Dermatosis is a skin condition where there is cracking and peeling of the weight-bearing areas of the soles. The condition occurs primarily (but not exclusively) in children who have atopic dermatitis (eczema), asthma or hay fever. Their skin seems more sensitive than the skin of others and friction appears to play a role. Boys aged 3 to 14are most commonly affected. This condition tends to be better in winter when shoes and socks are being worn, deteriorating in summer due to increased friction with the foot moving more in sandals, particularly if sweaty. Wearing socks and shoes made of synthetic material can exacerbate the condition. The soles become shiny and glazed with some scaling, painful cracks and fissures. Sometimes the heel and palms are affected as well. The tops of the feet, the web spaces between the toes and the instep are typically spared. A diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on a medical history and the appearance of the rash. However, investigations such as skin scrapings or patch tests may be needed to distinguish it from other skin conditions (such as psoriasis, keratolysis exfoliativa, contact allergic dermatitis or fungal infection). Prognosis is good as the condition usually resolves by puberty.

        "Sweet’s Syndrome": "Also known as … Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis, Gomm-Button Disease What is it? Sweet’s syndrome is an uncommon condition named after the English dermatologist, Dr Robert Sweet, who first described it in 1964. Sweet’s syndrome usually presents with fever, a rise in white blood cells, raised red skin rashes and neutrophils (pus cells) infiltrating the upper layer of the skin. Fever and a rise in white blood cells are not always present. Sweet’s syndrome is sometimes initially mistaken for an infection or medication allergy. Sweet’s syndrome is a disorder of neutrophils (pus cells) and although it is not considered hereditary, there is some evidence of a genetic link. Most experts consider Sweet’s syndrome a “reactive condition” – it is driven by an underlying condition in up to 50% of cases. As the appearance of Sweet’s syndrome may occur before the underlying condition is recognised, ongoing monitoring is required, especially if the skin eruption is severe, recurrent or treatment-resistant or if blood abnormalities are detected. Sweet’s syndrome is a disorder of neutrophils (pus cells) and although it is not considered hereditary, there is some evidence of a genetic link. Most experts consider Sweet’s syndrome a “reactive condition” – it is driven by an underlying condition in up to 50% of cases. As the appearance of Sweet’s syndrome may occur before the underlying condition is recognised, ongoing monitoring is required, especially if the skin eruption is severe, recurrent or treatment-resistant or if blood abnormalities are detected. A skin biopsy performed by a dermatologist usually confirms the diagnosis. This shows neutrophils, some breaking down, entering the upper layer of the skin, particularly around the blood vessels.  The blood vessels may be damaged by chemicals released by the neutrophils. Blood tests are used to confirm a raised white cell and neutrophil count.  Blood tests also show inflammatory markers, such as ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) as being raised. Other tests such as urine tests, bone marrow testing, cancer screening and imaging studies (x-rays, CT scans) and tests to rule out infection are sometimes needed to look for associated conditions of Sweet’s syndrome. Sweet’s syndrome is treated by trying to identify and cure any underlying or associated disorder. In more than 50% of cases no cause or underlying medical association is found and the condition is treated with corticosteroid tablets (prednisone or prednisolone). Generally a rapid improvement is expected and the dosage of corticosteroids is gradually reduced over several weeks or months. Corticosteroids can be applied as a cream or injected into areas of Sweet’s syndrome in mild localised cases. Alternative treatments may be used in cases where corticosteroids are not effective or safe (e.g. the presence of a serious infection).  In small studies, a good response to indomethicin and colchicine or potassium iodide has been reported. People with Sweet’s syndrome have responded well to other drugs affecting neutrophil function including: “anti-infective” agents (eg dapsone, clofazimine, metronidazole or doxycycline); retinoids (eg isotretinoin); pentoxifylline and thalidomide; Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents (eg methotrexate, cyclosporine, chlorambucil) and biologic agents. The outcome of Sweet’s syndrome may be related to that of the underlying disorder if present, e.g. malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis etc.  With treatment, the fever and blood count usually improve within a couple of days and the rash clears within a few weeks. Some cases will clear without treatment over a number of weeks.  Recurrent episodes of Sweet’s syndrome affect about one-third of all Sweet’s syndrome cases and some will require long-term therapy. Most areas of Sweet’s syndrome fade without permanent marks but the appearance of pigmentation (brown marks) may take several months to fade.

        "Syringoma": "What is syringoma? Syringomas are benign skin tumours most commonly seen around the eyelid area. Uncommonly they can occur around the genital area. Eruptive forms of syringomas may occur on the chest, neck and abdominal areas. Syringomas are relatively easy to treat but they often recur after treatment.  What causes syringoma? The name “syringoma” is derived from syrinx, the Greek word for tube or pipe. Syringomas are benign tumours of the sweat ducts (eccrine glands). These tumours lie in the mid to deep (dermal) layers of the skin. What does syringoma look like? Syringomas are multiple skin-coloured small lumps measuring 1 to 3 mm in diameter. In people with skin of colour (pigmented or dark skin), they may appear as yellowish or pale bumps. Syringomas are more common in women and most frequently appear during or after adolescence. The most common location is around the eye area. In eruptive forms of syringoma the trunk, chest and abdominal areas are involved. The majority of syringomas are not associated with symptoms. Some people may experience itching with sweating. Syringomas are more common in Asians and people with darker skin types. What other problems can occur with syringoma? The majority of syringomas are spontaneous. Inherited (genetic) factors play a role in some cases. Inherited syringomas usually occur in pre-adolescence. Eruptive syringomas have been reported in Down syndrome. Syringomas have also been associated with other rare genetic conditions such as Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. How is syringoma diagnosed? Most cases are diagnosed by their appearance. A biopsy may be needed to exclude other similar kinds of tumours such as trichoepitheliomas, trichodiscomas, fibrofolliculomas as well as milia and basal cell cancers. Biopsies of syringomas show comma-shaped sweat ducts in the dermal (deep) layers of the skin. How is syringoma treated? Syringomas are benign so they do not require treatment. However, they may be treated if they are disfiguring. The aim of treatment is to reduce the visibility of the tumour rather than eliminate it completely. This reduces the risk of scarring. In order to achieve this, the upper portion of the syringoma is treated reducing its size.  If complete ablation or tissue removal is carried out too deeply, scarring may result.  More recently fractional ablative lasers have been introduced allowing treatment of the deeper component of the syringoma with much reduced risk of scarring. People with darker skin types are at greater risk of scarring. It is wise to treat a small test area first. If this is successful, without complications or unacceptable scarring, then a larger area can be treated. Syringomas can recur after all forms of treatment as they penetrate into the deep dermis or deeper layers of the skin. Specific treatments Fully ablative or fractional ablative devices including CO2 and erbium laser are most commonly used. For darker skin types, the erbium laser may be preferred. Dermatologists may combine fully ablative with fractional laser treatment in the same session allowing treatment to the deeper component of the syringoma. Healing times range from 5 to 14 days. In darker skin types, temporary hyper or hypo-pigmentation may occur which can last several months. If fractional laser treatment is used on its own, without combined fully ablative laser, several treatments will be required for the best results. Fractional laser is sometimes used over the entire area around the eye to blend the fully ablated areas with the background skin if the treated areas are too pale. For syringomas localised to a small area, excision (surgical removal) of the area may be an excellent method of treatment. In fair-skinned individuals, scissor excision can be effective for protuberant lesions. However, excision is not recommended in darker skin types as pigment changes may occur and may take months to resolve. Complications Recurrence, hypertrophic (thick) or atrophic (depressed) scarring and excessive dyspigmentation (a too dark or too pale appearance) are uncommon complications. What is the post treatment prognosis? Treatment is usually successful. However, syringomas are likely to recur and maintenance treatment may be necessary. Recurring syringomas can be safely treated again. This information has been written by Dr Davin S Lim and Dr Philip S Bekhor Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Telangiectases": "Also known as … Spider Veins, Angioectasias, Broken Blood Vessels or Capillaries What are telangiectases? Telangiectases are superficial blood vessels, which are visible with the naked eye. The majority can be improved with laser treatment or sclerotherapy. They are caused by dilated blood vessels under the surface of the skin or in mucous membranes. These spots may occur spontaneously or as a result of various underlying medical conditions or procedures (see list below). They are small, blanchable red spots between 0.5 to 1mm in diameter, which are visible to the naked eye. They occur on various parts of the body or mucous membranes depending on the underlying cause. The most commonly affected areas are the nose, cheeks, chin and legs. They often occur in isolation and are not associated with primary cutaneous disorders. Some secondary causes include: Physical associated telangiectases as a result of: Blood vessels secondary to primary condition in: Conditions associated with telangiectases include: Investigations are not always necessary as telangiectases are diagnosed from their typical appearance. However, if an underlying medical cause is suspected the dermatologist will determine if further investigations such as skin biopsies, imaging or blood tests are needed. Treatment is necessary only if the lesions cause symptoms or if they are a cosmetic concern. Specific treatments include: Colour matched makeup is an excellent method of covering up redness associated with telangiectases. Green-tinted foundations and creams are especially helpful in concealing redness. Laser therapy is an effective method for treating facial telangiectases. The correct types of lasers are readily available in many dermatologist practices. Lunchtime procedures can be organised depending on the extent of the area being treated. IPL can be very effective in treating small to medium-sized facial telangiectases. Larger telangiectases respond better to longer wavelength lasers. Fine needle hyfrector may be used but there are more side effects than with laser therapy. They are harmless and the vast majority of cases are not associated with an underlying medical condition. Laser treatment, when performed by a dermatologist, often removes these spots safely and effectively.

        "Telogen effluvium": "What is telogen effluvium? On the normal scalp about 95% of the hairs are in the growth phase (anagen), a few follicles are moving from growth to resting phase (catagen) and 5% are in the resting phase (telogen). The growing hairs all have a growth cycle that is independent of the others on the head. Each hair on the scalp grows for 1 to 3 years before entering the resting phase, which lasts about 3 months.  On average, about 80 to100 hairs are lost each day. These are hairs that have reached the end of resting phase. These hairs are seen accumulating in the brush/comb, or the drain in the bathroom. On the scalp the hair growing period is longer, which is why the hairs on the scalp are longer than hairs on other parts of the body. When a large number of hair follicles simultaneously enter the telogen phase, increased shedding of hair occurs. What causes telogen effluvium? Telogen effluvium results when the normal ratio of growing and resting hairs is altered, and the percentage of hair follicles in telogen is increased. The hair shedding is usually noted 3 to 4 months after the trigger. The triggers for telogen effluvium can be physiological or pathological. There are no symptoms or changes seen in the scalp skin. In newborns and after childbirth, large numbers of hair follicles are programmed to enter telogen phase at the same time. Significant shedding postpartum (after childbirth) is common. These are both considered to be physiologic telogen effluvium. Emotional stress due to a major life event (such as severe trauma, loss of a loved one, change in employment) is a common trigger. Severe illness, surgical operations, high fevers (especially if prolonged), thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus are also known to trigger telogen effluvium.  In some cases, there may be a nutritional deficiency in association with crash dieting, significant weight loss or anorexia nervosa. Some medications are known to be associated with telogen effluvium. These include some blood pressure tablets, anti-epileptic medications, high doses of vitamin A, oral retinoids and blood thinning agents. Stopping oral contraceptives can also trigger telogen effluvium. In some people, a cause may not be identified. Telogen effluvium can last between 3 to 12 months. Chronic telogen effluvium is where the hair shedding lasts more than 6 months. This is more common in middle-aged women who often report long, thick hair prior to the onset of hair shedding. Chronic telogen effluvium may occur at the same time as female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). What are the symptoms of telogen effluvium? Affected individuals experience an increase in hair shedding which is apparent with shampooing or brushing. This is associated with diffuse (all over) thinning of the hair. This may not be so obvious to others but those affected by it often report a significant reduction in hair volume. How is telogen effluvium diagnosed? The diagnosis is suggested on clinical history and examination. The dermatologist is often able to demonstrate a positive hair pull test. This is where a handful of hair is pulled with firm traction. A positive pull test is where 4 to 6 hairs are extracted, indicative of active hair shedding.  Biopsies may be needed to exclude other causes of hair loss such as alopecia areata or androgenetic alopecia. Your dermatologist may request a blood test to rule out an underlying cause for your hair loss. How is telogen effluvium treated? Even though this condition can be very alarming and distressing, telogen effluvium is a temporary, self-limiting hair loss condition. Regrowth is expected in most cases, often within 6 to 9 months, although it may take longer. There is no medical treatment that can be given to hasten the hair growth. The hair normally grows about 1cm a month so it takes about 9 to12 months for the hair to regain its original thickness. Your doctor will look at the margins of the scalp. It is easier to see the regrowth occurring at these sites.  The degree of regrowth experienced depends on age, hormones, genetics and general health. Some people experience complete regrowth. Peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women often experience less regrowth than younger women as there is an age-related reduction in the total numbers of active hair follicles as an individual ages. Identifying and addressing any triggers such as nutritional deficiencies can be helpful. It may be useful to seek psychological support given stress is commonly a trigger and the hair loss itself is often very distressing for the affected individual. Telogen effluvium can return in some individuals if the underlying trigger recurs.

        "Tinea capitis": "Also known as ringworm of the scalp What is tinea capitis? Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp and hair. It most commonly affects children between three to seven years of age but adults can also be affected. What causes tinea capitis? Tinea capitis is caused by a dermatophyte fungus. Infection may result from direct contact with an infected person, animal or from contact with a contaminated object (known as a fomite), e.g. hairbrush, comb, hat, towel, pillowcase or linen. The fungal spores can live for a few months on contaminated objects and infect a new person. There are two major families of dermatophyte fungus that infect the scalp – Trichophyton (abbreviated as T) and Microsporum (abbreviated as M) fungi. These fungi are classified according to where they most naturally and easily grow e.g. in humans (anthropophilic), in animals (zoophilic) and in soil (geophilic). The most common causes of tinea are T. tonsurans and M. canis. T. tonsurans is usually passed from one infected person to another. M. canis is passed on from an infected animal such as a kitten or a dog to a human. Tinea capitis is more commonly found in crowded living environments. What does tinea capitis look like? Some people present with dry itchy scaly areas on the scalp with patches of hair loss (alopecia) that grow slowly over months. Some people present with black dots in the areas of hair loss. The black dots are the broken off hairs near the scalp. Some people may develop an angry red mass (kerion) with pus and yellow crusts together with patches of hair loss. Others develop large yellow crusts throughout the scalp (scutula). Individuals affected with tinea capitis commonly have enlarged lymph glands on the back of their necks and ears. How is tinea capitis diagnosed? Tinea capitis is diagnosed by a doctor. The doctor will suspect the diagnosis based on the appearance of the scalp and can confirm it by taking hair plucks and scrapings from scalp skin and having these examined under a microscope and sending them for culture. The doctor may use a special light called a Wood’s light (long wave ultraviolet light) to identify some types of fungi. In cases that are not typical, the dermatologist may also request a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. What other problems can occur with tinea capitis? When tinea capitis is not treated early and correctly, it can cause permanent hair loss with scarring. More severe infections can be associated with systemic symptoms such as feeling unwell with fevers, pain in involved areas and enlarged lymph glands. Some people can experience a dermatitis or eczema-like rash (called an id reaction) elsewhere on their body if the fungal infection is very extensive or severe. How is tinea capitis treated? Treatment is started as soon as the dermatologist suspects the diagnosis because it can take several weeks to identify the fungus through cultures. Most cases need oral antifungal tablets such as griseofulvin, fluconazole, itraconazole or terbinafine. Griseofulvin is most commonly used first especially for children. Treatment can take up to 6 weeks. In some cases, the dermatologist may request blood tests to check liver function. In cases that fail to respond, other antifungal agents may be needed. In addition to medication, it is very important that the affected person also uses antifungal shampoos such as 2% ketoconazole shampoo to decrease the chances of spreading the infection whilst the tablet is taking effect. Close family members should do the same. All hairbrushes, combs, hats, towels, pillowcases and linen need to be disinfected (e.g. washed in hot water and ironed or treated with household bleach) to prevent the  condition from recurring. Schools should be notified especially if the fungus is a type that can be passed from person to person so that classmates can be examined by their doctor and treated if necessary. What is the likely outcome of tinea capitis? Most tinea capitis, when treated early and correctly, will not result in permanent hair loss or scarring. Follow up Individuals who are diagnosed with tinea capitis should be followed up by a dermatologist during and after the treatment to monitor for side effects and ensure clearance of disease.

        "What is tinea onychomycosis?": "The term tinea generally refers to fungal infection of the skin and its appendages. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails, and accounts for 50-60% of abnormal looking nails. 1 It often results from untreated or unrecognised tinea pedis (fungal infection of the feet). ",
        "Who gets tinea onychomycosis?": "Tinea onychomycosis is more common in older adults, diabetics (both type 1 and 2), individuals who are immunocompromised and athletes. ",
        "What causes tinea onychomycosis?": "Onychomycosis is caused by various fungi such as dermatophytes, yeasts and less often non-dermatophyte moulds. Infections can spread from direct contact with an infected individual or from public swimming pools, showers and change rooms. Other predisposing factors and associated comorbidities include repeated injury to the nail, prolonged use of occlusive footwear, sweaty feet, smoking, obesity and other skin disorders such as psoriasis. ",
        "What does tinea onychomycosis look like?": "Onychomycosis can present in several different patterns, including: Others may present with swollen and red nail folds (paronychia) and white, yellow, green or black marks appearing on the adjacent nail. This is typical of a Candida infection. ",
        "How is tinea onychomycosis diagnosed?": "The diagnosis is usually made clinically based on the appearance of the nails, and can be confirmed by taking nail clippings from the end of the infected nail. The nail clippings will be examined under a microscope, and the lab will also try to grow the fungus from the nail (culture). In some cases, a nail plate histology may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. ",
        "How is tinea onychomycosis treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Fingernail infections are usually cured more quickly than toenail infections. General measures may be helpful in preventing the recurrence of onychomycosis, such as: Treatment options may include: Avulsion of the nail or removal of the infected area may be useful in some circumstances. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of tinea onychomycosis?": "When treated early and correctly, most onychomycosis will not result in permanent nail damage or deformity. If onychomycosis is left untreated, it can lead to discolouration and deformation of the nail and long-term nail destruction.

        "Pityriasis versicolor": "Also known as tinea versicolor What is pityriasis versicolor? Pityriasis versicolor is a common skin rash in puberty and early adult life but can occur in infants. It is more common in warm humid environments and may be seasonal. Most people with this condition are concerned about the appearance of the rash. Sometimes it may cause minor symptoms such as scaling, itch or irritation. It can be much more widespread if there is a problem with the immune system. What causes pityriasis versicolor? Pityriasis versicolor is a skin reaction to overgrowth of normally occurring yeast organisms (Malassezia genus, formerly known as Pityrosporum) living on the skin. About 90% of healthy people have these yeast organisms growing on their skin but they grow in larger numbers with sweating and humidity and where the sebaceous (oil) glands in the skin are very active.  Some people may have an inherited predisposition to overgrowth of these organisms. The yeast produces chemicals which may affect the normal pigment production in the skin. What does pityriasis versicolor look like? The typical appearance of the rash is of a discoloured round or oval shaped eruption most commonly on the upper trunk region, sometimes extending to the neck or upper limbs.  Occasionally, the rash may affect other areas of the body. The colour of the eruption may appear lighter or darker than the surrounding normal skin, hence the name “versicolor”. The rash itself may be slightly raised with a fine scale. How is pityriasis versicolor diagnosed? The diagnosis of pityriasis versicolour is based on a clinical examination and the typical appearance of the eruption. The affected skin may show yellowish fluorescence under long wave ultraviolet light (Wood’s lamp) examination. Samples may be taken from the fine scaly skin of the eruption to check for the typical yeast organisms. In rare cases, a skin biopsy taken under local anaesthetic may be required for examination under a microscope. How is pityriasis versicolor treated? Treatment may be required if the rash is causing concern. Treatment is directed towards reducing the number of yeast organisms living in the skin of the affected areas, using an anti-fungal preparation applied directly to the skin. Examples include imidazole lotions or creams (such as ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole) and anti-dandruff shampoos (such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, selenium sulphide, ciclopirox olamine). For smaller areas, one of the imidazole creams or lotions may be suitable and may be applied once or twice daily for 1 to 4 weeks. For larger areas, one of the above anti-dandruff shampoos may be used as a body wash. The shampoo is applied to the whole affected area (after wetting the skin) and left on for 5 to 10 minutes before washing off. This is to allow time for the active ingredient to penetrate into the skin and hair follicles to reduce the number of yeast organisms. The treatment is performed daily for 1 to 4 weeks and subsequent maintenance therapy once or twice a week may be required to prevent recurrence. The effectiveness is generally improved with a longer course of treatment and a higher concentration of the active ingredient. If skin irritation occurs, treatment should be stopped and medical advice obtained. Oral anti-fungal treatment may be considered in unusually severe or resistant cases but there is a risk of side effects and drug interactions occuring with these oral medications. Your doctor will discuss these issues. The discolouration of the skin may take some months to return to normal, even after successful treatment.

        "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and (Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)": "What are TEN and SJS? Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are extremely rare, sudden onset, often life-threatening reactions to medications occurring in the skin and the linings of the mouth, the gastrointestinal tract, genitalia and eyes. The affected person has a fever and there may be enlargement of the lymph nodes and inflammation in the liver and other organ systems. SJS is a less severe manifestation involving mainly the lips, eyes and genital mucosa. In TEN large areas of skin are killed by the immune reaction precipitated by the drug, leading to severe pain and loss of skin similar to that seen in burns. In SJS less than 10% of the skin is affected. In TEN more than 30% of the skin is involved. People with 10-30% skin loss are classified as “overlap”. What causes Toxic epidermal necrolysis? TEN is more frequently seen in people who have a specific genetic make-up (genotype) that leads to slow metabolising of certain classes of drugs, or those who have HIV or are immune suppressed. Various medications have been associated with the development of SJS and TEN. In SJS a drug can be incriminated in 50% of cases. In TEN drugs are involved in 95% of cases. They are mostly systemic drugs (oral or injection forms) but some cases have come from topical use as well. Commonly associated medications include antibiotics (sulphonamides), antifungals, antivirals, allopurinol (gout medication), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants. The onset of the adverse drug reaction usually occurs within 7 to 21 days of commencing treatment. What does TEN look like? Flu-like symptoms such as generalised aches and pains, sore throat and runny nose often precede the rash. TEN develops as a flat, tender, red rash that starts on the face and trunk and rapidly spreads to the rest of the body, including mucous membranes (linings of mouth, guts, wind pipes, eyes and genitals). The size of the rash expands and often forms blisters. A gentle touch or rub can peel the skin off and it is very painful. The condition often spreads over hours to days. The active phase can last up to two weeks. How is TEN diagnosed? There is no specific laboratory test needed to diagnose TEN or SJS. The history of the development of the rash and a physical examination usually suggest the diagnosis. A skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or other blistering diseases. Blood tests are often required to assess the fluid/nutritional status and to identify complications. What other problems can occur with TEN? As the skin is the physical barrier protecting the body against infections and keeping water inside the body, the loss of the top layer of skin in TEN and SJS leads to severe problems of dehydration and increases the risk of infection. Infections are a common cause of death in those affected with TEN.  In the short term, individuals can also develop dehydration, multiple organ failure and blood clots. How is TEN treated? The first step is to stop the medication. After this, the treatment for TEN and SJS is mainly supportive care until the top layer of skin regenerates. Affected individuals are often transferred to a burns or intensive care unit and treated as if they have suffered from very severe burns. They require life support, fluid and electrolyte replacement and antibiotics to treat infections. Usually, affected individuals are managed in a multidisciplinary team that includes a dermatologist. Specific treatments Some reported cases have benefited from immunoglobulins, immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporin), systemic steroids or other biologic agents. However, evidence of their effectivenes is limited and controversial. What is the likely outcome of TEN? TEN is a life-threatening condition that is associated with high mortality rate. It is estimated to be about 5-12% for SJS and 30% for TEN. In the long term, those who survive from TEN may be left with pigmented and scarred skin, damaged nails and joints, and eye problems. What follow up is needed for TEN? People who develop TEN require follow up to identify the likely cause of the condition to that it can be avoided.  To prevent any recurrence, affected individuals should discuss any new medications with a doctor and a pharmacist prior to commencement to check the similarity of the chemical compounds.

        "Traction Alopecia": "What is traction alopecia? Traction alopecia is the name given to a type of hair loss most commonly seen in people with skin of colour (pigmented skin).  In its earliest stages hair loss may be reversible. Without treatment however, the condition can lead to permanent hair loss. What causes traction alopecia? Traction alopecia  occurs as a result of continuous pulling or tension applied to the hair. Hairstyles that may cause this condition include weaves, cornrows, braids and tight ponytails or pigtails. Dreadlocks and hair extensions may also contribute to the problem. What does traction alopecia look like? In the early stages traction alopecia appears as small sore pimples on the scalp. If untreated it may progress, to areas of hair loss. This is most commonly seen around the temples or sides of the scalp. How is traction alopecia diagnosed? Formal investigations are not necessary if the affected person has had a history of wearing tight hairstyles before the hair loss occurred. A scalp biopsy is only necessary when other causes of hair loss (scarring alopecia) need to be ruled out. How is traction alopecia treated? Early intervention and treatment is essential because once hair loss has occurred, it is irreversible and permanent. It is important to stop the tension being applied to the hair as soon as possible and start treatment. This means changing to looser hairstyles.  Steroid and antibiotic creams can be used to treat traction alopecia in the early stages. Oral antibiotics and the injection of steroids in inflamed areas may be helpful in some cases. Advanced cases may require cosmetic camouflage with wigs or hair transplants.

        "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)": "What is TSC? TSC is a genetic disorder that can affect multiple organs including the skin, brain, kidneys, heart and lungs. The incidence is reported to be between 1 in 5800 and 1 in 10000. What causes TSC? TSC is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait which means that the child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. About two thirds of cases are new mutations but the parents of an affected child must be closely examined as it is possible to have the condition very mildly. What is the first sign of TSC? White patches on the skin of 1-3cm, called ash leaf or hypomelanotic macules, are the first sign and are present at birth or appear in early infancy (Figure1). Many people have one or two white patches as harmless birthmarks but the presence of three or more increases the likelihood of the condition. Seizures starting in infancy are the next most common sign.  What are other skin signs? Facial angiofibromas are small, red spots that start to appear on the cheeks, nose and chin between two and five years of age. They are initially flat but become more raised over time (Figure 2).  Forehead fibromatous plaque is a slightly yellowish to skin coloured raised area on the forehead or scalp, present in about 20% of affected individuals. Shagreen patch is a raised, orange peel like area of skin, usually present over the lower back. It is rarely seen in infancy but increases in size and number with age, eventually affecting just under 50% of affected individuals. Periungual fibromas (Koenen’s tumours) are skin coloured or reddish growths around the nails, developing in later childhood and adult life. What other organs are affected? A range of growths develop in the brain with 90-96% of affected individuals developing epileptic seizures. The seizures start in the first two years of life in 85% of cases. Autism and impaired intellectual ability occur in 40-50% of affected individuals, more commonly in those who have had frequent seizures from an early age. The kidneys develop lumps called angiomyolipomas in up to 80% of cases. Cysts can also develop. The heart can have a growth called rhabdmyoma in 47-60% of affected individuals. These mostly reduce in size with age. The lungs can be affected, particularly in young and middle aged women, by a  condition called lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Other changes include dental enamel pitting, growths on the gums (gingival fibromas) and white streaks on the back of the eye (retinal hamartomas). How is TSC diagnosed? The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, using major and minor diagnostic criteria. Molecular genetic testing is also available but is only able to find the mutation in 75-80% of cases. A negative genetic test does not exclude the condition. How is TSC treated? Seizures are treated with anti-seizure medication and occasionally surgery. Medications called mTOR inhibitors are used for some of the brain and kidney growths and to treat lung complications. These medications can be used in a topical (cream) form to prevent the facial angiofibromas enlarging and bleeding.

        "Urticaria": "Also known as…Hives What is Urticaria? Urticaria, or hives (sometimes referred to as welts or wheals), is a common skin condition that produces an itchy rash. It tends to come and go and can last for a variable period of time. It is sometimes accompanied by angioedema, which is swelling deeper in the skin, typically affecting the lips and peri-orbital areas of the face, but which may also involve the upper airways. The condition can be acute (lasting less than 6 weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than 6 weeks). It may be caused by a trigger, but most cases of urticaria have no known cause. Urticaria occurs due to the release of chemical mediators including histamine from mast cells in the skin. These mediators activate sensory nerves and cause small blood vessels to leak. This process is usually triggered by various immune pathways such as circulating IgE antibodies. The cause of this immune triggering is unknown in the majority of cases, but are commonly associated with various types of infections. Other triggers include chronic immunologic diseases, stinging and biting insects, allergy to foods or medications. The use of intravenous dyes during some radiological tests can sometimes trigger urticaria as well. Physical urticaria is urticaria which develops with skin exposure to heat, cold, pressure, exercise, water, vibration or sunlight. These conditions probably result from heightened skin sensitivity, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Urticaria typically is a smooth, raised rash. The colour can range from normal skin colour to pink or red. The rash may occur anywhere on the body and often starts off as small round spots that quickly enlarge and spread. The rash can be intensely itchy, but usually only lasts minutes to hours and then disappears within 24 hours. A viral or bacterial illness can occur before urticaria develops. Some chronic medical conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, mastocytosis or rheumatoid arthritis may occur with chronic urticaria. If the rash becomes painful, starts to show bruise like staining of the skin or lasts longer than 36 – 48 hours, then another condition called urticarial vasculitis should be suspected. No specific tests are required for acute urticaria, as the condition is often expected to resolve spontaneously, and tests to try to find a specific cause are usually not helpful. Allergy testing may be required if a specific food or contact trigger is suspected. For chronic urticaria, tests involving blood, urine and stool specimens may be required to identify any infection or underlying chronic immune disorder that may be causing the condition. The specific triggers that have been identified (such as a food or medication) should be avoided. In most cases, acute urticaria is self-limited and resolves spontaneously within 6 weeks. During this period, treatment with oral antihistamines is indicated for relief of itch and swelling. Antihistamines are commonly available as over-the-counter medications. These are often needed at higher doses than described on the package. They are very safe and helpful, but need to be taken regularly. In cases where antihistamines fail to control symptoms, stronger medications may be needed. Chronic urticaria is also frequently treated with antihistamine medication. They can often be effective in stopping itch, helping the rash to resolve and preventing future outbreaks of urticaria. If antihistamines are inadequate, other treatments are available. These include other histamine blockers, leukotriene inhibitors, phototherapy, hydroxychloroquine and immune suppressing medications. For chronic spontaneous urticaria, an injectable prescription medication called Omalizumab may be indicated for use in patients unresponsive to antihistamines. Medication usually needs to be continued for many weeks and long term treatment may be required in some cases to keep the condition under control.

        "Warts": "Also known as…Human Papillomavirus, Verrucae Vulgaris or Papillomas What are they? Warts are abnormal growths of the skin and mucosa caused by an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). The HPV family is made up of more than 100 different types. The common types in the skin include HPV-1, HPV-2, HPV-4 and HPV-27. These cause skin warts that are common in childhood and tend to disappear with increasing age. About 90% of all genital warts are caused by low-risk types such as HPV-6 and HPV-11. However, there are high-risk types such as HPV-16 and HPV-18 that are known to cause cancers. The infection is transmitted by direct person-to-person skin contact from an HPV infected person, from one part of the body to another in the same person, or indirectly through contaminated surfaces such as public areas (e.g. swimming pool, gymnasium). It can take up to a year for the wart to appear for the first time. HPV infects the cells in the outer layer of the skin, causing them to grow and form a wart. Warts are common in school-aged children but may arise at any age. They are more numerous and persistent in people who are immunosuppressed. Many people who become infected with HPV quite rapidly develop immunity and so do not develop any warts or other symptoms. The appearance of warts will differ in certain body sites. Most warts on the skin will disappear of their own accord. In children, even without treatment, 50% of warts disappear within 6 months and 90% resolve within 2 years. Warts are more persistent in adults, but may resolve eventually.  Some warts, such as plantar warts, may persist and become large and painful. Periungual warts can distort nail growth. The high-risk types of HPV (e.g. HPV-16 and HPV-18) have the potential to cause cancers such as cervical cancer, penile cancer, oral or anal cancers, and some types of skin cancer. Cancer developing in common warts is rare. Individuals with reduced immunity (e.g. immunosuppressant medication, HIV-infection) may develop multiple warts that are difficult to treat. In rare cases, a child can acquire HPV from an infected mother during delivery. This may result in warts appearing inside the airway causing hoarseness of the voice. Warts are contagious. Warts are often diagnosed through a clinical examination. A doctor may use dermoscopy (skin surface microscopy) to distinguish warts from similar spots such as seborrhoeic keratoses (commonly known as “age warts”). In rare cases, a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Many people choose not to treat warts because treatment can be uncomfortable and troublesome. Treatments should not cause any scarring as most warts may disappear on their own. Once started, it is important to persist with the treatment until the wart is gone. Pregnant women or those planning pregnancy should avoid certain treatments and discuss this with the treating doctor before commencing treatment. Local therapy Systemic therapy There are many other therapies available but the clinical evidence for their effectiveness is lacking. HPV vaccinations are available to prevent anogenital warts.  Vaccination prevents initial infection with HPV types 16 and 18 which cause most of the HPV associated cancers. Vaccination may also protect against HPV types 6 and 11 which cause 90% of genital warts. Individuals on a treatment plan must be followed up on a regular basis to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and potential adverse reactions such as redness, swelling or blistering. Many treatments will need to be repeated or different treatments may need to be combined in order to eradicate the wart.

        "Pompholyx": "Also known as … Dyshidrotic Eczema or Vesicular Eczema of Palms and Soles What is Pompholyx? Pompholyx is an often recurrent and frequently extremely itchy disorder characterised by tiny blisters and bumps on the sides of fingers, toes, palms and soles. The cause of pompholyx is unknown. Pompholyx is considered a localised reaction pattern seen in other forms of dermatitis such as atopic dermatitis and allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. Pompholyx is characterised by the sudden onset of crops of symmetric, firm, deep-seated tiny blisters on the palms, sides of fingers and less often on the soles and toes. These may aggregate and form larger blisters. Intense itch and/or burning sensation usually precede the eruption. The attack can subside spontaneously over weeks to months. It is often recurrent. In long-standing cases, the individual’s fingernails may discolour or develop ridges.Occasionally a bacterial infection, cellulitis or lymphangitis may develop. Diagnosis of the pompholyx reaction pattern is based on a clinical examination of the hands and feet. A detailed history and wider clinical examination of the skin is needed in order to rule out an associated condition and guide further investigations. The following associated conditions should be considered:• Atopic eczema        o May be a late stage reaction and there may not be many other signs of dermatitis. History of past dermatitis is relevant.• Contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis – nickel, cobalt, chromium and cosmetics have all been associated with a pompholyx reaction. Patch testing may be required.• Irritant contact dermatitis has also been associated with pompholyx.• Infections       o Inflammatory fungal infections may be associated with an id or pompholyx like reaction.       o Examination and investigations for evidence of bacterial or fungal infection may be required.• Stress can be associated with a worsening of the pompholyx.• Pompholyx has been associated with some immune system modifying agents.• Hyperhidrosis of hands and feet may be associated with an increased likelihood of contact dermatitis and fungal infections that may trigger the pompholyx reaction. Pompholyx may be difficult to treat. It is important to treat an associated condition, if present. General advice:• Avoid contact with irritants or allergens• Use bland unscented moisturisers or just plain water, to clean hands• Wear protective gloves in everyday activities• Stop smoking• Apply bland moisturisers frequently Topical therapy:The cornerstone of topical therapy is high-strength cortisone creams that may be appliedwith wet wraps or cling wrap to increase their effectiveness. Other anti-inflammatorycreams such as calcineurin inhibitors can also be effective. Management of bullae or blisters:Blisters can be managed with compresses soaked in a very light pink solution of potassium permanganate or Burrow’s solution (10% aluminium acetate solution diluted to 1:40). Large blisters can be aspirated (pierced with a sterile needle). Oral medications:A short course of oral anti-inflammatory medication such as prednisolone may be required in severe flare-ups of pompholyx. For severe, recalcitrant and chronic cases, corticosteroids may be combined with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin. Antihistamines can be helpful in treating the associated itch in some people. Phototherapy and photochemotherapyVariable effects have been reported using topical PUVA, oral PUVA or narrowband UVB to help control the inflammation.

        "What is vitiligo?": "Vitiligo is a relatively common condition in which the skin is unable to produce pigment. Pigment forming cells (melanocytes) are destroyed and the skin becomes white. ",
        "Who gets vitiligo?": "Vitiligo affects up to 2% of the global population. 1 Its prevalence is relatively consistent between all races but appears to be less common in the Han Chinese population and more common in India. Both men and women appear to be equally affected and it can occur at any age. A family history is present in 10-36% of cases. 2 ",
        "What causes vitiligo?": "The cause of vitiligo is unknown. It is most likely an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues. In vitiligo, pigment forming cells are targeted. In individuals who are predisposed to developing the condition, injury to the skin, emotional factors and stress may aggravate the condition. ",
        "What does vitiligo look like?": "Vitiligo appears as white areas with sharp edges on the skin usually without any preceding inflammation occurring in the affected skin. Vitiligo can develop in areas of skin injury such as a cut or burn (including sunburn or an abrasion). The condition may be seen under the arms, in the groin, or between the buttocks where one skin surface rubs against another. White hairs can occur in the scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows and beard. Eye involvement can also occur. White areas of skin commonly start to appear in an individual’s twenties and thirties but for some individuals these may first appear in childhood or later in adult life.

        "How is vitiligo treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. Fair skinned individuals may decide not to be treated at all as the contrast between the white areas and the natural skin colour may not be obvious. The treatment of vitiligo is frequently prolonged, and progress can be slow. Complete re-pigmentation is not always achieved. Psychological support plays an integral part in the treatment of individuals with vitiligo. Some specific treatments may include: 4 ",
        "What is the likely outcome of vitiligo?": "The outcome can vary widely with some individuals experiencing stable or slow progression with limited spread over time. In others it may progress more rapidly leading to widespread depigmentation. Various factors such as the rate of progression and response to treatment will affect the outcome.

        "Warts": "Also known as…Human Papillomavirus, Verrucae Vulgaris or Papillomas What are they? Warts are abnormal growths of the skin and mucosa caused by an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). The HPV family is made up of more than 100 different types. The common types in the skin include HPV-1, HPV-2, HPV-4 and HPV-27. These cause skin warts that are common in childhood and tend to disappear with increasing age. About 90% of all genital warts are caused by low-risk types such as HPV-6 and HPV-11. However, there are high-risk types such as HPV-16 and HPV-18 that are known to cause cancers. The infection is transmitted by direct person-to-person skin contact from an HPV infected person, from one part of the body to another in the same person, or indirectly through contaminated surfaces such as public areas (e.g. swimming pool, gymnasium). It can take up to a year for the wart to appear for the first time. HPV infects the cells in the outer layer of the skin, causing them to grow and form a wart. Warts are common in school-aged children but may arise at any age. They are more numerous and persistent in people who are immunosuppressed. Many people who become infected with HPV quite rapidly develop immunity and so do not develop any warts or other symptoms. The appearance of warts will differ in certain body sites. Most warts on the skin will disappear of their own accord. In children, even without treatment, 50% of warts disappear within 6 months and 90% resolve within 2 years. Warts are more persistent in adults, but may resolve eventually.  Some warts, such as plantar warts, may persist and become large and painful. Periungual warts can distort nail growth. The high-risk types of HPV (e.g. HPV-16 and HPV-18) have the potential to cause cancers such as cervical cancer, penile cancer, oral or anal cancers, and some types of skin cancer. Cancer developing in common warts is rare. Individuals with reduced immunity (e.g. immunosuppressant medication, HIV-infection) may develop multiple warts that are difficult to treat. In rare cases, a child can acquire HPV from an infected mother during delivery. This may result in warts appearing inside the airway causing hoarseness of the voice. Warts are contagious. Warts are often diagnosed through a clinical examination. A doctor may use dermoscopy (skin surface microscopy) to distinguish warts from similar spots such as seborrhoeic keratoses (commonly known as “age warts”). In rare cases, a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Many people choose not to treat warts because treatment can be uncomfortable and troublesome. Treatments should not cause any scarring as most warts may disappear on their own. Once started, it is important to persist with the treatment until the wart is gone. Pregnant women or those planning pregnancy should avoid certain treatments and discuss this with the treating doctor before commencing treatment. Local therapy Systemic therapy There are many other therapies available but the clinical evidence for their effectiveness is lacking. HPV vaccinations are available to prevent anogenital warts.  Vaccination prevents initial infection with HPV types 16 and 18 which cause most of the HPV associated cancers. Vaccination may also protect against HPV types 6 and 11 which cause 90% of genital warts. Individuals on a treatment plan must be followed up on a regular basis to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and potential adverse reactions such as redness, swelling or blistering. Many treatments will need to be repeated or different treatments may need to be combined in order to eradicate the wart.

        "Well’s Syndrome": "Also known as … eosinophilic cellulitis Well’s Syndrome is a rare inflammatory skin disease which tends to come and go over many years. It can sometimes be confused for cellulitis, an infection of the skin. The cause of Well’s Syndrome is not known. However, it has been linked to allergies, insect bites, infections, cancers of the bone marrow and blood, or drugs. Well’s Syndrome often begins as a burning or itching sensation in the skin, followed by the development of raised, red and swollen patches on the skin. These patches can change colour very quickly, starting off as bright red, then turning brown or bluish-grey. You may also notice small lumps or blisters developing on your skin. Other symptoms include tiredness and fevers. There are no known problems that occur with Well’s Syndrome. Your doctor may want to exclude any underlying causes of Well’s Syndrome such as cancers or infection. The diagnosis is made by taking a small sample of skin, known as a skin biopsy. Your doctor will ask you a few questions about your skin and general health. He/she may also want to perform other investigations such as blood and urine tests, and possibly a chest X-ray to look for any possible triggers. Well’s Syndrome responds very well to steroids. Other treatments may be considered such as anti-histamines, minocycline, dapsone, or Griseofulvin. Your doctor will also treat the underlying cause for your Well’s Syndrome if it is identified. Well’s syndrome is not a dangerous condition. It is known to come and go, and it can often resolve on its own over weeks to months without any scarring This information has been written by Dr. Samantha Ting and Dr. David Cook Published November 2020 Disclaimer 2019 © Australasian College of Dermatologists.

        "Striae": "Also known as stretch marks, striae rubra (red stretch marks), striae alba (white stretch marks) What is striae? Stretch marks are extremely common, affecting over 70% of the population. There are two types of stretch marks – striae rubra (red or new stretch marks) and striae alba (white or old stretch marks). New stretch marks are more responsive to treatment than old stretch marks. What causes striae? Stretch marks, as the name suggests, are due to stretching of the skin, which results in altered structural support in the deeper layers of the skin. Microscopic studies of stretch marks show alteration in collagen and diminished elastin, as well as dermal oedema (swelling). Early stretch marks exhibit an increase in the number of blood vessels and inflammation, resulting in pink-purple discolouration. What do striae look like? The first signs of stretch marks are pink to purple lines usually running crosswise on the trunk and lengthwise along the limb. Early stretch marks may be itchy. Over time stretch marks lighten and develop a pale, wrinkled appearance known as striae alba. Stretch marks most commonly occur on the abdomen, inner arms, the back and breast areas. Stretch marks may also develop in the groin and armpits if high strength steroid creams are inappropriately used in these areas. What other problems can occur with striae? How are striae diagnosed? Stretch marks most often occur in otherwise normal individuals and no investigations are needed to make a diagnosis. Stretch marks may occur in people who have Cushing’s, Marfan’s or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Investigations are determined from clinical examination. How is striae treated? Stretch marks are a cosmetic problem and treatment is optional. The majority of stretch marks will fade over time. Early red stretch marks respond better to treatment than older, white stretch marks. No treatment will remove stretch marks completely. Treatment of red stretch marks Treatment of white stretch marks White stretch marks can be very difficult to treat. Expect only a mild to modest improvement with multiple sessions. Treatment methods include: What is the likely outcome of striae? The majority of stretch marks will improve over time, changing colour from red-purple to pink, then finally achieving a white wrinkled appearance. Treating early stretch marks with laser treatment combined with vitamin A creams gives the best outcome.

        "What is xeroderma pigmentosum?": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic condition which is characterised by extreme sun sensitivity. It manifests as skin pigmentation changes, sunburns and an increased risk of skin cancers. Approximately 25% of affected individuals will have associated neurological manifestations. ",
        "Who gets xeroderma pigmentosum?": "XP occurs in all ethnic and gender groups. ",
        "What causes xeroderma pigmentosum?": "It is caused by a mutation on one of eight genes. It is autosomal recessive, meaning two copies of the defective gene are needed to develop the disease. If both copies are present, the disease occurs 100% of the time. ",
        "What does xeroderma pigmentosum look like?": "In some individuals, XP may present as reddening in the first few weeks of life due to an exaggerated sunburn response. In other individuals, they will often develop freckle-like pigmentation on sun-exposed areas such as the forehead and cheeks in early childhood, usually before the age of 2 years. Other associated skin findings are hypo- and hyperpigmentation, warty growths and accelerated photoaging. Individuals with XP tend to have problems with their eyes, ranging from dry eyes and sensitivity to light, to visual impairment. They may be prone to neurological problems, such as reduced deep tendon reflexes, progressive hearing loss, difficulty remembering things, balance impairment and acquired decrease in size of the brain (microcephaly). 1 ",
        "How is xeroderma pigmentosum diagnosed?": "If XP is suspected, a blood test and/or skin biopsy may be performed to confirm diagnosis. Individuals may also be referred to a genetics clinic. ",
        "How is xeroderma pigmentosum treated?": "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual and their needs. General preventative measures may include protecting against and avoiding sun exposure. When the UV is 3 or above, all five forms of sun protection should be used, including: Other measures to avoid sun exposure include: Vitamin D supplements may also be suggested. Individuals with XP, should become familiar with their skin and organise an appointment with their GP if they notice any changes to skin spots, to detect potential skin cancers early. As the condition also worsens amongst individuals who smoke, smoking cessation is recommended. ",
        "What is the likely outcome of xeroderma pigmentosum?": "Individuals with XP may be at an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

        "Zinc Deficiency and the Skin": "What effect does zinc deficiency have on the skin? Zinc deficiency results in skin changes that can look like atopic dermatitis in the early stages. The difference is that zinc deficiency does not improve when treated appropriately with topical steroids and moisturisers. The skin takes on a cracked, glazed and fissured “crazy paving” appearance around the mouth, the nappy area and the hands.  The person may experience hair loss, nail changes and an increased chance of getting diarrhoea as well as skin and other infections. The affected person may be irritable and experience a general failure to thrive. What causes zinc deficiency? Zinc deficiency can be inherited Zinc deficiency may occur as a result of: Medical conditions that may have similar symptoms Rare inherited or acquired metabolic conditions that result in deficiencies in amino acids, essential fatty acids and biotin can result in skin signs that mimic zinc deficiency. Glucagonoma is a rare tumour that can also result in similar skin findings. How is zinc deficiency diagnosed? Severe cases of zinc deficiency can be diagnosed with a blood test measuring zinc levels however this is less reliable for mild deficiency. Alternatively, zinc deficiency may be diagnosed by testing for: Sometimes the success of a trial treatment is proof enough of the existence of a zinc deficiency (Note: When treating a zinc deficiency, you would expect to see rapid improvement in the appearance of the skin, with marked improvement within 72 hours). How is zinc deficiency treated? Zinc replacement is the treatment of choice. The dosage varies depending on the underlying cause of the deficiency. For example: The replacement dose is based on the amount of “elemental” zinc content needed. Zinc is available as zinc sulphate and zinc gluconate and 10 mg of zinc sulphate may contain 2.27 mg of elemental zinc.  For a 10 kg child a 1 mg/kg replacement dose would be approximately 44mg of zinc sulphate. Zinc gluconate is better absorbed than zinc sulphate. For children, capsules can be opened and added to food, or tablets can be crushed and added to food. Some pharmacists make up a solution for zinc replacement in children. Be aware that high dose zinc replacement can affect copper absorption. In food, zinc content is directly related to protein content, and this may be significant for those who are on protein restricted diets.

        "Naevus spilus": "Also known as speckled lentiginous naevus, zosteriform lentiginous naevus What is naevus spilus? Naevus spilus is a type of birthmark that consists of a flat brown background patch containing darker brown spots or tiny bumps. What causes it? Naevus spilus is caused by a localised defect in melanoblasts (the forerunners of pigment cells) that populate a particular area of the skin. There is some controversy as to whether naevus spilus represents a birthmark known as a variant of a congenital melanocytic naevus, or it is acquired later on in life. What does it look like? A variable number of black, brown or red-brown spots or tiny lumps are seen within a flat patch of tan-to-brown hyperpigmentation. The “background” tan patch is usually noted at birth, or soon after, while the spots within the patch appear over time. Any site of the body might be affected. The spots or bumps within the background stain are usually moles called pigmented naevi. There are many types of these including junctional, compound and intradermal naevi, Spitz and blue naevi. There are reports of cutaneous melanoma arising within a naevus spilus but this is extremely rare. How is naevus spilus diagnosed? Diagnosis is by visual inspection. A skin biopsy will be needed if atypical features are present or there is a history of recent change. How is naevus spilus treated? Initially, naevus spilus should be photographed to document stability of the lesions. A biopsy will be needed for any suspicious areas. Affected individuals should check the area as part of their regular full body self-examination and note any changes. Laser treatment may be considered when the appearance of the naevus is of cosmetic concern. Both the Q-switched ruby and Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers have been used to treat the background hyperpigmentation and the speckles of naevus spilus. However, results are variable – some lesions respond well while others do not. Regular self-examination is still necessary, even after successful treatment. You should seek medical advice for any unusual or new changes in appearance.

It’s a warm, moist place that invites fungal infections, bacterial infections, and rashes. Jock itch is a fungal infection also known as tinea cruris. It’s a common culprit when the urge to scratch is overwhelming. Scrotal eczema is also a possible cause of itching for many men.",
        "Eczema": "Eczema, or dermatitis, is a term that encompasses a few skin conditions. Areas of skin that are either dry and scaly, or moist and inflamed characterize the condition. Eczema is common in children, but people of all ages can develop it. As many as 31 million Americans have some type of eczema. Sometimes called “the itch that rashes,” eczema may begin itching even before the rash becomes full-blown. Scratching the itch contributes to development of the rash. Eczema is not contagious. Eczema often appears as patches of irritated, red or reddish-gray skin. Over time, small, fluid-filled bumps that ooze and crust over may develop. Most people experience periods of time when their skin dries out and may even seem to clear up, only to have it flare up again. Although it can appear anywhere on the body, eczema is often seen on the: Scrotal eczema can spread to the skin around the anus, between the buttocks, and on the penis. ",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of scrotal eczema are similar to general symptoms of eczema and may include: ",
        "Causes": "The cause of eczema isn’t fully understood. It varies depending on the type of eczema you have. The skin of your scrotum is more absorbent than much of your skin. This makes it vulnerable to toxins and irritants that can cause eczema. Eczema tends to run in families, so you’re more likely to have scrotal eczema if a family member also has it. Other skin conditions, like other types of eczema, may also lead to scrotal eczema. Additional risk factors include: ",
        "Diagnosis": "Your primary care doctor can usually diagnose eczema by looking at the rash. If you have severe or prolonged episodes of scrotal eczema, you should see a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor that specializes in the treatment of skin diseases. If you’re concerned about your eczema and don’t already have a dermatologist, you can view doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool. Your doctor will examine your eczema and may scrape off a small sample of your skin. A technician in a laboratory will study the skin sample to identify the source of the rash. Scrotal eczema is often mistaken for jock itch. Here are some differences between the two conditions:  ",

        "Tips for prevention": "Here are some steps you can take to reduce your risk for eczema flare-ups: There are two different nerve pathways associated with itching. Histamine, the substance your body produces when you’re allergic to things, triggers one pathway. The other cause is not related to histamine. Instead, nerve pathways transmit the sensation of itching to your brain. Conditions like scrotal eczema or psoriasis activate these nerve pathways.  "

Many of them, however, only stay on the surface of the skin and don’t provide deep penetration to the other upper layers. These oils including: ",
        "Essential oil or fixed oil": "Plant oils can be categorized as either an essential oil or a fixed oil. Essential oils are much more potent and can severely irritate your skin if not diluted or used correctly. In most cases, fixed oils can be used without being diluted. They’re made up of a number of fatty acids, waxes, phospholipids, and more, which can affect different aspects of your skin in a variety of ways. ",

Cold-pressing doesn’t involve heat or other chemicals that could change the chemical makeup of the oil. Rosehip oil contains a high number of antioxidants and unsaturated fatty acids. These ingredients help make it an effective topical treatment for skin conditions like eczema. Studies have shown that rosehip oil has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities, which offer benefits such as smoother, more elastic skin. ",
        "How to treat eczema with rosehip oil": "Treating atopic dermatitis with rosehip oil is straightforward. Use the rosehip oil as you would a regular moisturizer. One recommended method is to bathe or shower briefly in warm water twice a day. After gently patting yourself dry, apply the oil to the affected area. ",

Although rosehip oil is generally considered safe for topical use, those with very sensitive skin or plant allergies may risk increased irritation or an allergic reaction. ",
        "Takeaway": "Before treating your eczema with rosehip seed oil, understand your eczema triggers. Learning what irritates your skin and causes a reaction is crucial for managing eczema. This knowledge can help you determine what medications or alternative treatment options are best for you. Speak with your doctor or dermatologist before starting any at-home treatments so they can provide guidance specific to you and your current health conditions. "

        "The early years": "My mother’s father was a pediatrician. Though my grandfather didn’t say much about my skin, he always had some strong cortisone cream for me when we visited. He told us it was just one of those things kids had, and he was sure it would go away. Our family doctor also told my parents and I that my eczema would vanish by itself one day. There was nothing to be done except to use the prescribed cream two or three times a day, take oatmeal baths, and wait. So I dutifully slathered on my lotions, but my skin itched. It was intense. Imagine having 20,000 mosquito bites. That was how I felt all the time. “Don’t scratch,” my dad would say in his nonchalant way when I tore at my skin without really thinking about it. “Don’t scratch,” my mom repeated when she saw me reading, watching TV, or playing a game. Pain was a relief from the itch. I didn’t mean to cause my skin to break open and constantly need to repair itself. Sometimes that would happen even if I just rubbed it too hard with a towel or other fabric. Eczema made my skin fragile, and over time cortisone made the layers thin. Broken skin can get infected. So while my body was working hard on repairing a lot of scraped-up spots along my arms, legs, back, stomach, and scalp, it had fewer defenses for colds, flus, and strep throats. I caught everything going around. One particular day when I was crying from the pain of getting into the bath, my mother decided to take me to another skin specialist. I was admitted to a hospital for tests. Everything came back normal. The only thing I was allergic to was dust. No one had any answers, and I was told to learn to live with it. Then I went to college and almost died. ",
        "Off to college": "I chose a school in Southern California for two simple reasons: It had a terrific chemistry program, and the weather was warm all year. I was going to become a chemist and find cures for diseases, and my skin was always better in the summer. Sniffles and sore throats were something I usually walked around with, so everything seemed normal as I went to classes, played cards with friends in our dorm, and ate in the cafeteria. We all had mandatory mentor meetings because the small school prided itself on taking good care of the students. When I visited my mentor, and I was sick once again, he became very concerned. He drove me himself to his personal physician. I was diagnosed with mononucleosis, not a cold. I was told to get a lot of rest. I couldn’t sleep because the pain in my throat and congestion had gotten so bad that lying down was unbearable. My roommate and friends became alarmed as my body swelled, and I couldn’t talk because it felt like I had glass in my throat. I wrote on a small chalkboard, that I wanted to fly to my parents. I thought this was the end. I was going home to die. I was wheeled off the airplane to my father. He tried not to panic as he took me to the emergency room. They put an IV in my arm, and the world went black. I woke up days later. Nurses told me that they didn’t know if I would make it or not. My liver and spleen had almost burst. I survived, but teachers, administrators, my parents, and friends all asked me to quit school and learn how to be well. The biggest question was how? Eczema had made the mono much worse and was a constant battle my body fought against. The answer came when I was well enough to travel. I visited a friend who had moved home to London, and by accident, I found the National Eczema Society there and joined. The literature had many cases like mine. For the first time, I wasn’t alone. Their answer was to embrace a vegan diet. ",
        "A new diet, a new life": "Though there isn’t much conclusive evidence to show a strong connection between a plant-based diet and an eczema cure, some pilot studies have shown that a diet without animal products can be hugely beneficial. There are some who vouch that a raw, vegan diet is the solution to eczema. Of course, drastically changing your diet is no easy feat. Growing up in Minnesota, I ate the basic four food groups: meat, milk, bread, and produce. I liked fruits and vegetables, but they had been extras next to other foods on the plate. A plant-based diet was new for me, but I tried switching things up by eliminating all dairy and meat. The difference was astonishing. Within two weeks of adopting my new diet, I had clear skin for the first time. My health soared, and I’ve been eczema free ever since. It took years of research and experimentation to find the right balance of animal-based and plant-based foods that kept me healthy. This is what works for me, so I can stay healthy and eczema-free: I also embrace healthy dishes from around the world, which are fun to eat and to make. ",
        "The takeaway": "While it may be hard to believe, I now see my eczema as the gift that gave me terrific health. Though at times it was scary, living with and managing my eczema helped me find a way of life that, in addition to clearing up the condition, is healthier and fuller today. And now I laugh when people tell me I have such beautiful skin. Susan Marque is a versatile writer with an eclectic background.

        "How diet can impact eczema symptoms": "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, inflamed, and itchy skin. It is a dermatological condition thought to be driven by inflammation. In high-income countries, it affects an estimated 20% of children and 10% of adults. Despite its high prevalence, experts are still figuring out what influences the risk of developing eczema and what makes it worse. Although there are likely a wide range of factors, experts believe that diet plays a role. Scientists have already investigated a number of dietary aspects, including maternal diet, omega-3 intake, and probiotics. However, many questions remain. ",
        "More sodium led to worse symptoms": "The latest study used data from 215,832 people aged 37–73. Of these, 10,839 had an atopic dermatitis diagnosis. They estimated 24-hour urine sodium excretion from spot urine samples and used this to gauge participants’ usual dietary sodium intake. Their analysis showed that a 1-gram increase in estimated 24-hour sodium excretion was associated with an 11% increase in the odds of having atopic dermatitis. It was also linked to a 16% increased odds of having active atopic dermatitis and an 11% increased odds of having more severe symptoms. To validate this finding, the scientists also analyzed data from more than 13,000 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. They showed that a 1-g per day increase in dietary sodium — estimated using diet questionnaires — was associated with a 22% higher chance of having atopic dermatitis. ",
        "Past links between eczema and dietary sodium": "According to the authors of the new study, a German textbook published more than 100 years ago recommends a low-salt diet for people with atopic dermatitis. However, this recommendation had little data to back it up. More recently, scientists have started to take more interest in the links between dietary sodium and eczema. For instance, recent research shows that eating fast food more than three times each week is associated with worse eczema severity in children. Although fast food certainly is high in added salt and sodium, other components of the food, such as sugar, fat, or additives, may have influenced these outcomes. However, a small study from 2019 found that people with atopic dermatitis had higher sodium levels in affected parts of their skin compared to healthy skin. The same study showed that elevated sodium levels may influence the immune system, which suggests that sodium could play a part in the condition’s severity. ",
        "Salt and the immune system": "Katrina Abuabara, MD, associate professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the authors of the new study, explained to Healthline how sodium and salt intake can impact atopic dermatitis symptoms and the immune system overall. “It is hypothesized that sodium is stored in the skin to prevent water loss and may help prevent infection. However, it can also activate cells in the immune system, triggering some inflammatory pathways and removing the ‘brakes’ from others,” Abuabara said. “One study has examined this process specifically in atopic dermatitis,” she told us, “but more research is needed to understand the impact of sodium on atopic dermatitis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.” Abuabara said despite the findings, physicians are unlikely to suggest dietary changes just yet. “This study was the first step in that we were able to show an association between dietary salt and atopic dermatitis in a large population,” she explained. However, she also told us that more research is needed before recommendations change. “I think it is important to have experimental evidence that dietary salt can improve eczema symptoms before we recommend dietary changes specifically for eczema.” However, Abuabara said that many American adults may benefit from eating less sodium for other health reasons. “The average American eats more than the recommended amount of salt, and low-salt diets have been proven to reduce the risk of heart disease, especially among older adults,” Abuabara said. ",
        "How to reduce salt intake": "With this in mind, we spoke with Lucy McCann, MD, a registered associate nutritionist and clinical academic researcher. She provided some tips on ways to reduce sodium intake in your diet. She recommends the following: Overall, McCann, who was not involved in the study, told us that “for most people, home cooking is not the problem, rather, the salt in ultra-processed, prepackaged, or fast foods is the primary reason for high dietary intake. Reducing your intake of these foods could make a real difference to your overall salt consumption.” ",
        "Takeaway": "A large-scale study suggests that consuming more salt may increase the risk of having active atopic dermatitis and be linked to more severe symptoms. However, more research is needed, and Abuabara plans to continue the investigation. “We are about to begin enrolment for a National Institutes of Health-funded study to better understand the relationship between dietary sodium, skin sodium, and eczema severity over time,” she told Healthline.

        "Does it work?": "Although experts still don’t know what causes eczema, they think it may have something to do with an overactive immune system. Since vitamin E helps regulate the immune system, it may also help minimize outbreaks. In a 2016 study, 96 patients with atopic dermatitis, a type of eczema, were treated with either oral vitamin E or a placebo every day for 8 months. Those who were treated with vitamin E saw significant improvement and near remission in symptoms by the end of the study. They also found a 62% decrease in immunoglobulin E (IgE) serum levels among the vitamin E-treated group. Since high lgE antibody levels can indicate that the body overreacts to allergens, they may be a trigger for eczema outbreaks. As a result, researchers concluded that vitamin E could indeed be a therapeutic remedy to treat atopic dermatitis. In a 2021 review, researchers noted that oxidative stress and inflammation are some triggers believed to be involved in the onset of atopic dermatitis. Due to vitamin E’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, researchers concluded that the vitamin has serious potential as a complementary treatment for eczema. Researchers also pointed to animal and human studies that employed oral, topical, and injected vitamin E. All four studies, which were conducted from 2012–2014, had positive outcomes on eczema symptoms. Although more research is needed before drawing conclusions, so far, evidence suggests that vitamin E could be a promising treatment for eczema, especially alongside traditional treatments like corticosteroids. ",
        "How to use it": "Topical vitamin E can be found in many creams, serums, and oils. It’s easily absorbed into the skin and may boost the amount of vitamin E stored in your sebaceous glands. Consider doing a patch test before trying any product containing vitamin E. Apply a tiny amount of the product on your skin and wait about 24 hours. If you don’t have any negative reaction, it’s safe to apply all over, including on your outbreaks. Vitamin E oil tends to be very thick and sometimes challenging to spread. That said, it works well to moisturize eczema-prone skin, which tends to be very dry. Consider adding a carrier oil, such as coconut or sunflower oil, to the vitamin E oil for easier application. Products containing vitamin E can be purchased over the counter. ",
        "Diet and supplements": "At this time, there’s no evidence to suggest that any method of consuming or applying vitamin E is more advantageous than another. For that reason, consuming vitamin E-rich foods may be just as beneficial for the skin as applying it topically or taking a supplement. According to 2020 research, several randomized, controlled trials have shown that vitamin E supplementation can improve atopic dermatitis symptoms as well as inflammatory allergic reactions. Foods rich in vitamin E include: Since vitamin E tends to be absorbed in the body better when taken with vitamin C, you may also want to implement plenty of both vitamins in your diet. ",
        "Potential risks": "Even in high quantities, eating foods rich in vitamin E isn’t a reason for concern. And as long as you do a patch test beforehand, vitamin E oil shouldn’t cause any topical issues. But like with most supplements, taking beyond the recommended dosage can elevate your levels too high and cause potential health issues. The dosage recommendation can vary, but the typical recommendation can range from 15–1000 milligrams (mg) per day. Consuming large quantities of vitamin E supplements can cause excess bleeding or intracranial hemorrhages, so always check the supplement dosage before taking it. According to the National Institutes of Health, teenagers, adults, and pregnant people should take no more than 15 mg daily. It’s also suggested that large doses of vitamin E supplementation could increase the risk of prostate cancer in otherwise healthy individuals. Consider speaking with a medical professional to determine if taking vitamin E supplements would be helpful based on your care needs. ",
        "The bottom line": "Evidence suggests vitamin E is a safe and effective way to minimize or significantly reduce eczema flare-ups. Both topical and oral vitamin E seem to have beneficial effects on symptoms. You can also consume vitamin E naturally from foods, including seafood, seeds, nuts, and green vegetables. Most of the time, treating eczema requires a multifaceted approach. Using vitamin E alongside traditional treatments like corticosteroids may provide the best results. "

        "How we vet brands and products": ". Turmeric, also known as Curcuma longa, is a yellow spice native to India. It’s also a popular herb in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. It contains the compound curcumin, which has been widely shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Therefore, it has historically been used to treat an array of inflammatory skin conditions, such as eczema (1). However, you may wonder whether using turmeric can truly fight eczema and if it’s safe. This article tells you all you need to know about turmeric and eczema.",
        "What is eczema?": "Also known as atopic dermatitis, eczema is one of the most common skin conditions, affecting 2–10% of adults and 15–30% of children (2). Eczema presents as dry, itchy, and inflamed skin, resulting from a dysfunctional skin barrier that leads to excess water loss. There are many types of eczema, but all are characterized by undesirable patches on the skin (2, 3). The underlying cause of eczema is unknown, but a person’s genetics and environment appear to be linked to its development (2, 3). Common treatments include special moisturizers and topical anti-inflammatory creams during flare-ups to minimize itching and restore the skin’s moisture barrier. However, given the increased popularity of natural remedies, many people are turning to herbal medicine for relief. Eczema is one of the most common inflammatory skin conditions in children and adults. Common symptoms include dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. ",
        "Turmeric and eczema": "Due to turmeric’s anti-inflammatory properties, many wonder whether it can alleviate eczema symptoms. Although the spice has been used for centuries as a natural treatment for skin disorders, there is little research specifically on turmeric and eczema (4). In a company-sponsored study in 150 people with eczema, using a turmeric-containing cream for 4 weeks resulted in nearly a 30% and 32% decrease in skin scaling and itchiness, respectively (5). However, the cream also contained other anti-inflammatory herbs, which could have contributed to the improvements. Therefore, the study could not conclude that turmeric alone relieved eczema symptoms (5). Moreover, a 2016 review of 18 studies found early evidence to support curcumin use, both topically and orally, for treating skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis (4, 6, 7). Still, the researchers called for more studies to determine the dosage, efficacy, and mechanism of action. Apart from these studies, there is little additional research on the oral, topical, or intravenous use of turmeric or curcumin for the treatment of eczema. Research on turmeric and eczema is limited. Still, at least one study found significant improvements in eczema symptoms after using a topical cream containing the spice and other herbs. Additional studies suggest it may aid other skin conditions as well. ",
        "Safety and precautions": "Although there is limited research on turmeric and eczema, some people may still choose to use it. Turmeric is generally recognized as safe to consume by the Food and Drug Administration. However, it may also be used topically. Some people may have used turmeric intravenously, but this route has led to serious reactions, including death (8). ",
        "Food and supplements": "There is extensive research on the health effects of consuming turmeric. It’s generally recognized as safe, and curcumin has been shown to have no adverse health effects in healthy people when taken in doses of up to 12,000 mg per day (9). Still, keep in mind that the curcumin in turmeric has low bioavailability. Therefore, consuming ground turmeric may not provide a therapeutic dose (9, 10). While some studies report finding little to no curcumin in the bloodstream after ingestion, especially in doses below 4,000 mg, curcumin may still provide beneficial effects (10, 11). Another study detected curcumin in the blood more easily by using an alternate testing method (12). Adding black pepper to turmeric dishes and supplements may help as well, as this spice contains a compound known as piperine, which can increase the absorption of curcumin. Still, it’s unknown how much curcumin might reach your skin (9, 10). Dietary fats, water-soluble carriers, volatile oils, and antioxidants may also enhance the absorption of curcumin, according to some research (12). Finally, the side effects of excessive turmeric intake may include skin rash, headache, nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach, and yellow stools (11). ",
        "Topical application": "Due to turmeric’s popularity, many cosmetic companies use it as an ingredient in their products. In studies on other skin conditions, topically applying turmeric-containing products allows for adequate absorption of curcumin (4, 9). However, these products are specifically formulated for enhanced absorption, and applying pure turmeric to your skin will not have the same effects (4, 9). Moreover, the spice contains a strong yellow pigment shown to stain the skin, which most people likely find undesirable (4). Although more research is needed, topical products containing the spice’s active ingredients appear to be safe for use. Speak to a healthcare professional if you have any concerns. ",
        "Intravenous": "Due to turmeric’s low bioavailability, there is an increasingly popular trend among natural healthcare professionals to provide it intravenously. By bypassing digestion, the curcumin from the turmeric spice enters the blood supply more easily, providing a substantially higher dosage (13). However, there is little research in this area, and major complications have been observed. In fact, a 2018 report found that intravenous turmeric for the treatment of eczema caused the death of a 31-year-old woman (14). Even with small doses, this type of intravenous treatment may cause unwanted side effects, such as headache, nausea, upset stomach, constipation, and diarrhea (15). ",
        "Safety in children": "Given eczema’s prevalence among children, many adults are looking for safe, natural remedies for their children. The use of ground turmeric in food is generally recognized as safe for both adults and children (8). However, there have been reports of lead poisoning from ground turmeric and supplements due to lead chromate, which is added to enhance the yellow color. This is most commonly associated with turmeric sourced from India and Bangladesh (16). Furthermore, supplementing with this spice is usually studied in adults, so it’s unknown whether it’s safe for children. Finally, it’s best to speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare professional before trying turmeric products for the treatment of eczema. Ground, supplemental, and topical turmeric are generally recognized as safe. However, intravenous treatment with the spice has been associated with serious side effects and death and should be avoided. ",
        "The bottom line": "Despite its potential health benefits, there is only early research supporting the use of turmeric or its active ingredient curcumin to treat eczema. If you’re looking to try turmeric for eczema, avoid intravenous treatment due to serious safety concerns. That said, ground turmeric has been used for centuries as part of herbal medicine and is safe for use. Try adding this spice or curry powder to your dishes for a kick of flavor. Topical products containing turmeric are usually formulated to be safe for use, although you should avoid directly applying the spice to your skin to prevent staining. Oral supplements may also be beneficial, though research has not yet determined effective doses specifically for eczema. Always speak to a healthcare professional before taking turmeric supplements, especially if you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, have a chronic condition, or intend to give it to your child. You may also want to talk to your medical provider about other treatment options for eczema. If your healthcare provider suggests giving turmeric a try, you can purchase supplements locally or online. Be sure to follow their dosage recommendation. "

        "1. Fish oil": "Fish oil helps boost your intake of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which may support skin health due to their powerful anti-inflammatory properties. There is some evidence that these fatty acids can suppress the activity of immune cells that trigger eczema. While research results have been mixed, several studies have found a link between fish oil supplements and improved eczema symptoms. Although more research is needed, some animal and human studies suggest that fish oil may be beneficial for treating eczema. ",
        "2. Vitamin D": "Your skin produces vitamin D — also known as the sunshine vitamin — when exposed to the sun. Vitamin D is also found naturally in several foods and is widely available as a supplement. Some research suggests that vitamin D may help treat eczema. One review of four studies concluded that supplementing with vitamin D was more effective at reducing the severity of eczema symptoms than placebo treatment. Another review of 21 studies associated lower vitamin D levels with increased eczema severity in children. It also found that supplementing with vitamin D improved eczema symptoms in about two-thirds of the studies. Multiple studies suggest that supplementing with vitamin D may reduce inflammation and symptoms of eczema. ",
        "3. Vitamin E": "Vitamin E is an essential micronutrient in various skin care products. In addition to its ability to protect the skin against oxidative stress, some studies have found that it may help decrease symptoms of eczema. A recent review has also concluded that a daily dosage of up to 600 IU of vitamin E is considered safe and may benefit skin health. Supplementing with vitamin E may help improve skin health and decrease symptoms of eczema. ",
        "4. Zinc": "Zinc is an important mineral that plays a key role in skin health. Several studies suggest it may help treat inflammatory skin conditions, including acne and eczema. One review of 16 studies also associated low zinc levels with a higher chance of eczema (19). Keep in mind that zinc is found in many food sources, including meat, seafood, dairy, and legumes, and most people can meet their needs by following a healthy, well-rounded diet. However, if you think you might have a deficiency, talk with a doctor to see whether supplementation may be beneficial. Some studies show that supplementing with zinc may help reduce eczema severity, especially if you have a deficiency. ",
        "5. Melatonin": "Although melatonin is best known as a sleep supplement, it may also help treat eczema. Research shows that melatonin may act as an antioxidant, reduce levels of specific inflammation markers, and inhibit eczema development. One study included 48 children. Taking 3 mg of melatonin daily for 4 weeks improved sleep quality and reduced eczema severity. However, further studies are needed, especially in adults. Melatonin may act as an antioxidant and reduce levels of inflammation. Some research suggests that it may decrease eczema severity in children, but more studies are needed. ",
        "6. Probiotics": "Probiotics are beneficial bacteria associated with numerous health benefits. Although research has found mixed results, some studies suggest that probiotics may help reduce symptoms of eczema. For instance, one study showed that infants who received probiotics were less likely to develop eczema than those in a control group. On the other hand, one review of 39 studies concluded that probiotics didn’t significantly affect symptoms or quality of life in people with eczema. Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether probiotics are beneficial for treating eczema. Some studies show that probiotics may help treat and prevent eczema, but research is conflicting. ",
        "What is the best vitamin for eczema?": "According to a meta-analysis of 10 studies, vitamin D3 had the most evidence for helping reduce eczema treatment, as well as the largest sample size. Vitamin D3 is a form of vitamin D along with vitamin D2. ",
        "Which vitamin deficiency causes eczema?": "There is some evidence showing an association between normal levels of vitamin D and reduced eczema symptoms in children. However, study findings have been mixed, and more research is necessary. ",
        "How can I reverse eczema naturally?": "It isn’t possible to cure eczema naturally, but some remedies can help. These include: ",
        "The bottom line": "Eczema can be frustrating and uncomfortable, but many supplements may help ease your symptoms. Remember that many nutrients can also be obtained from food sources by following a healthy, well-rounded diet. Also, be sure to talk with a doctor before using supplements to determine the best course of treatment. "

        "What is eczema?": "Eczema — also known as atopic dermatitis — is a skin condition in which you experience dry, itchy, skin that turns into a rash if you rub or scratch it (1). Other types of dermatitis exist, but eczema is by far the most common. It’s most common in babies and children, but it can persist well into adulthood (1). Experts believe that eczema happens as a result of a compromised skin barrier. This lets water escape from the skin more easily, causing it to become dehydrated. Research suggests that genetics may play a role in this. A mutation in the filaggrin gene may be one possible cause of the skin barrier dysfunction that often occurs with eczema. This gene affects the maturation of skin cells (2). A dysfunctional skin barrier can make it easier for harmful substances to penetrate the skin. People with eczema also appear to have fewer beta-defensins, which are compounds responsible for fighting invading viruses, bacteria, and fungi (1). As a result, they may be more prone to skin infections. In addition, the inflammatory immune response appears to be different in people with eczema. This may explain why their skin can become easily irritated by fragrances, soaps, detergents, or other allergens (1). People often treat eczema with fragrance-free moisturizing ointments on a daily basis, and many people use anti-inflammatory medications for flare-ups. Healthcare professionals often advise people with this skin condition to avoid triggers, such as harsh soaps, detergents, fragrances, and nonbreathable fabrics. Some people further report improvements after they cut out certain foods from their diet, such as those containing gluten (3). Eczema is a skin condition resulting from a dysfunction in the skin barrier. People usually treat it with topical ointments and by avoiding environmental irritants. However, some people also make dietary changes, such as avoiding gluten. ",
        "How gluten works in the body": "Gluten comprises a group of proteins that can be found in some grains, such as wheat, rye, and barley (4). These gluten proteins can be difficult for your gut enzymes to break down. In some cases, incompletely digested units of gluten — also known as gluten peptides — may cross over from the gut into the rest of your body (5). This can trigger an immune response. That’s what happens in gluten-related conditions like celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), and wheat allergy (4). ",
        "What’s the link between eczema and gluten intolerance?": "Three conditions can cause gluten intolerance (4): These three conditions are distinct, but their symptoms can overlap. This is the case for eczema, which can happen in all three of these conditions (6, 7, 8). ​​ Interestingly, there may be a link between gluten and eczema. One study reported that up to 18% of people with NCGS experienced skin issues. Eczema, rashes, and undefined dermatitis were the most common (9). Another study reported that people with eczema may be 1.6 times more likely to have celiac disease than those in the control group. However, only 0.6% of people with eczema also had celiac disease, so the absolute likelihood seems to be very small (7). ​​ Similarly, people with a wheat allergy often experience eczema as a result of eating gluten-containing wheat. However, they may not experience the same symptoms when eating other gluten-containing grains (4, 8). When your body doesn’t digest gluten completely, its breakdown products can travel from your gut into the rest of your body and cause inflammation. Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and NCGS all have eczema as an overlapping symptom. ",
        "Does gluten cause or worsen eczema?": "The cause of eczema is believed to be genetic. There’s currently no evidence that gluten causes it. That said, many people with eczema believe that what they eat can influence the severity of their skin flare-ups. Among all the possible dietary culprits, gluten is one that people commonly believe worsens their eczema (3). No evidence suggests that gluten causes eczema. However, some people who already have eczema have reported that eating gluten worsens their condition. ",
        "Does avoiding gluten relieve eczema?": "Although research suggests there may be a link between gluten and eczema, scientists have not conducted many studies to determine whether a gluten-free diet can offer relief from eczema. Moreover, the few published studies that exist have observed conflicting results. One recent study surveyed 169 people with eczema and found that around 40% of them tried a gluten-free diet as a way to reduce their symptoms. Of them, 51.4% reported improvements after cutting out gluten (3). However, a recent large study in women with eczema did not find a link between the two (10). ​ Scientists need to do more research to understand the relationship between gluten and eczema. In the meantime, a gluten-free diet may be worth trying so you can see whether it improves your eczema symptoms. Just keep in mind that such a diet needs to be well balanced to avoid the risk of nutrient deficiencies. It’s a good idea to seek out guidance from a registered dietitian to help you do this. A gluten-free diet may offer some relief from eczema for some people. However, more research is needed to investigate this relationship. ",
        "The bottom line": "People with an intolerance to gluten often experience eczema. On the other hand, people with eczema, regardless of whether they’re intolerant to gluten, often perceive that consuming gluten worsens their symptoms. Some evidence suggests that people with eczema may experience relief when they follow a gluten-free diet. However, few studies exist on this topic, and their results aren’t unanimous. Scientists need to do more research to investigate this potential connection. If you’d like to test whether going gluten-free improves your eczema, it’s best to seek guidance from a doctor or registered dietitian to ensure that you continue to meet your nutrient needs after you remove gluten-containing foods from your diet.

        "How we vet brands and products": ". Many people around the world live with skin conditions, including eczema. Though eczema is commonly treated with medicated creams, oral drugs, and even injections, people who have this condition often desire a more natural way to relieve their symptoms. Fortunately, research has shown that many dietary and lifestyle changes can benefit eczema. Fish oil, in particular, is a go-to supplement for many people with eczema due to its powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Yet, you may wonder whether supplementing with it really helps treat this chronic skin condition. This article reviews the effectiveness of taking fish oil for eczema.",
        "What is eczema?": "Atopic dermatitis, commonly known as eczema, is an inflammatory condition that affects the skin. The disease is chronic and typically starts early in life. Eczema is relatively common, with a prevalence rate of around 12% and 7% in U.S. children and adults, respectively (1, 2). Eczema causes adverse symptoms that can negatively impact quality of life, including severe itching, dryness, and redness of the skin. It can also result in cracked skin and skin lesions that weep fluid. These symptoms typically present in flares and then improve during periods of remission (3). They can lead to sleep and mood disturbances and issues with self-esteem. One study in U.S. adults found that receiving a diagnosis of eczema significantly increased the likelihood of depressive symptoms and severe psychological distress (4). Current research indicates that the cause of eczema is multifactorial. Skin barrier abnormalities, immune system dysregulation, genetics, and environmental exposure are all thought to play a part (5). Eczema is commonly treated with topical medicated creams, moisturizers, phototherapy during which the skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light waves, and oral medications, including steroids and immunosuppressive drugs (3, 5). Eczema is an inflammatory skin condition that causes various symptoms, including itchy, dry, and inflamed skin. ",
        "Why fish oil may help people with eczema": "The goal in treating eczema is to control and soothe symptoms and prevent flare-ups. Preventing inflammation is key when treating eczema, as the condition is considered to be an inflammatory skin disorder (3). Inflammation is a normal immune response that can protect against illness and infection. However, chronic inflammation can lead to adverse health effects, including increased disease risk (6). Both inflammation of the nervous system and skin contribute to the development of eczema. Fish oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known for their powerful anti-inflammatory properties. The omega-3 fats eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to counter inflammation in several ways, including by inhibiting the production of inflammatory proteins (7). Although research is ongoing, many studies have shown that supplementing with fish oil benefits those with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (8, 9). Due to fish oil’s potent anti-inflammatory potential, some studies have demonstrated that this supplement may also treat eczema, though larger studies are needed to substantiate this potential benefit (10). Research shows that fish oil has powerful anti-inflammatory effects. As such, fish oil supplements may benefit people with eczema. ",
        "Does fish oil reduce eczema symptoms?": "Fish oil is one of the most popular anti-inflammatory supplements on the market — and for good reason. Research shows that it may help treat many inflammatory conditions, including eczema. ",
        "Taking fish oil may benefit eczema": "Some research investigating the effects of fish oil supplements on eczema has shown promising findings. However, it’s important to note that there is a lack of research in this area, and more studies are needed. A 2012 review including 3 studies on fish oil supplements and eczema found that treatment with fish oil significantly improved quality of life and improved itchiness in people with eczema (11). However, it’s important to note that the researchers acknowledged that well designed, larger studies are needed to verify whether fish oil should be recommended as an alternative treatment for eczema (11). An older study from 2002 that included 22 hospitalized people with eczema found that infusion therapy with fish oil resulted in significant improvements in eczema severity, compared with an infusion of soybean oil (12). Another 16-week study in people with moderate to severe eczema demonstrated that supplementing daily with omega-3 fats, along with omega-6 fats, zinc, vitamin E, and a multivitamin, reduced eczema severity by more than 50% in over 80% of participants (13). Keep in mind that omega-3 fats were only one component of this treatment, so it’s unknown whether it would have had the same effect if it would have been used on its own. Animal studies have also shown positive results. A rodent study found that rats with eczema who were orally supplemented with fish oil for 30 days showed significant improvements in skin hydration and reductions in scratching behavior (14). Additionally, a study in mice found that treatment with DHA and EPA decreased eczema scores and reduced levels of inflammatory proteins and immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE is an antibody produced by the immune system in response to allergens, and high levels of it are associated with eczema (15, 16). Keep in mind that not all studies have shown positive results, and future research is needed to better understand how fish oil may benefit people with eczema. ",
        "Fish oil may prevent eczema from developing in infants and children": "Studies have shown that taking fish oil supplements while pregnant may help prevent the development of eczema in infants and children (17). In one study, pregnant women supplemented daily with 1.6 and 1.1 grams of EPA and DHA, respectively, from the 25th week of pregnancy through and 3–4 months of breastfeeding, on average. The results indicated that babies of mothers who took the supplement had a 16% lower risk of eczema during their first year of life, compared with a control group (18). In another study, infants of women who took 900 mg of combined DHA and EPA from fish oil from the 21st week of pregnancy to delivery had a 5% lower risk of eczema, compared with infants of mothers who received a placebo (19). Additionally, a review of 8 studies that included 3,175 children found a clear reduction in eczema among infants and children up to 36 months of age whose mothers supplemented with fish oil during pregnancy, compared with those whose mothers did not (20). However, not all studies have observed beneficial effects, with one study indicating that supplementing with fish oil during pregnancy may increase eczema risk in children (21). It’s clear that more research is needed before fish oil supplements during pregnancy can be recommended as a means to reduce childhood eczema. Supplementing with fish oil may improve eczema symptoms and decrease the risk of eczema in infants and children. However, more research is needed. ",
        "How to use fish oil to treat eczema": "Aside from the potential benefits related to treating eczema, taking fish oil supplements may benefit health in other ways as well, including improving heart health and reducing inflammation (22). Given the lack of current studies on fish oil supplementation in people with eczema, there is not a lot of information on the most effective dose for this purpose. An older study found that a dose of 5,500 mg of DHA per day for 8 weeks led to improvements in eczema symptoms, improved blood levels of omega-3 fats, and suppressed IgE antibody production. However, updated dosing information is scarce (23). Research also shows that taking up to 4,500 mg of fish oil containing up to 2,070 mg of DHA and 1,600 mg of EPA is safe during pregnancy and may help reduce eczema in children (20). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that the combined intake of DHA and EPA be kept under 3,000 mg per day, with no more than 2,000 mg from supplements. However, many studies have used higher dosing with no adverse effects (24). Most supplements on the market contain about 1,000 mg of fish oil concentrate per serving, which delivers varying amounts of EPA and DHA, depending on the product. Some supplements contain higher amounts of DHA, while others contain more EPA. Because amounts can vary between products, you should check the supplement label to find out exactly how much EPA and DHA you are ingesting per dose. Speak to your healthcare provider to find out how much fish oil you should be consuming per day for eczema treatment. ",
        "Fish oil precautions": "Fish oil is a popular supplement and considered safe for most people. Research shows that when taken in doses of up to 4–5 grams per day, fish oil supplements were not associated with any adverse side effects (22, 24). Some people may experience minor digestive symptoms, such as indigestion and diarrhea, when taking fish oil, though most people tolerate it well with no side effects. However, fish oil may prolong blood clotting time, which may cause interactions with blood thinning medications like warfarin when taken at high doses (25). Additionally, consult your healthcare provider before taking fish oil supplements if you have allergies to fish or shellfish (25). Given that dosing information is limited, consult your healthcare provider regarding proper dosing of fish oil for eczema treatment. Fish oil is considered a safe supplement, but it may interact with blood thinning medications at high doses. ",
        "The bottom line": "Eczema can negatively affect your quality of life, which is why it’s important to properly treat and control this chronic inflammatory skin condition. While conventional medications are typically the primary treatment method for eczema, natural therapies like fish oil may offer some benefits. Although research has shown promising results in using fish oil for the reduction of eczema symptoms, future studies are needed to fully understand how fish oil may help people with eczema.

        "What causes allergic eczema?": "Allergic eczema is also known as: It occurs when you come into direct contact with an allergen. The condition is known as a “delayed allergy” because it doesn’t trigger an allergic reaction right away. You might notice symptoms in as little as a few hours or as long as 10 days. Some common triggers for allergic eczema include: Allergic eczema may also develop when the skin is exposed to chemicals in the presence of sunlight. For example, you might have an allergic reaction after using sunscreen and spending time in the sun. ",
        "Recognizing the symptoms of allergic eczema": "The symptoms of allergic eczema can vary from person to person, and they may also change over time. Symptoms typically develop where contact with the allergen has occurred. In rare cases, symptoms might spread to other areas of the body. Common symptoms include: ",
        "How is allergic eczema diagnosed?": "First, a doctor will examine your skin to determine whether you have allergic eczema. If they suspect you have the condition, they’ll need to do further testing to find out exactly what you’re allergic to. ",
        "Patch test": "During a patch test, patches containing common allergens are placed on your back. These patches commonly remain in place for 48 hours. When the doctor removes the patches, they’ll check for symptoms of an allergic reaction. They commonly check again in a few days. ",
        "Biopsy": "If a doctor isn’t able to make a diagnosis based on a patch test, further tests may be needed. They may perform a skin lesion biopsy to make sure another health condition isn’t causing your skin condition. During the biopsy, the doctor will remove a small sample of the affected skin. They’ll then send it to a laboratory for testing. ",
        "How is allergic eczema treated?": "Treatment for allergic eczema depends on the severity of your symptoms. In all cases, though, it’s important to wash the affected skin with plenty of water to remove traces of the allergen. You may not need additional treatment if your symptoms are mild and don’t bother you. However, you might want to use a moisturizing cream to keep the skin hydrated and repair damage. Over-the-counter (OTC) corticosteroid creams can help with itching and inflammation. Your doctor may recommend prescription-strength ointments or creams if your symptoms are severe. They may also prescribe corticosteroid pills if needed. ",
        "What’s the outlook for people with allergic eczema?": "With the proper treatment, you can expect allergic eczema to generally clear up within 2 to 3 weeks. However, the condition may return if you’re exposed to the allergen again. Identifying the allergen that caused your eczema and taking steps to avoid it are critical in preventing future reactions. ",
        "The bottom line": "Allergic eczema, also called contact dermatitis, is a type of skin rash that occurs when you have an allergic reaction to a certain substance. Some common triggers include soaps, perfumes, and plants like poison ivy. It can occur a few hours or several days after you’re exposed to the trigger. While it often clears up on its own, you may need to see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. "

        "What are the symptoms of eczema in adults?": "The hallmark of eczema is itchy and inflamed skin. Several skin conditions fall under the category of eczema, so other symptoms may also be present. These symptoms can include: ",
        "What are the symptoms of eczema in babies?": "Eczema looks different in babies and toddlers than in older children and adults. In babies 6 months and younger with lighter skin, eczema may look red and a little wet or oozy. In babies 6 months and younger with darker skin, eczema may look purple or gray. Their skin may also be very itchy. Between 6 and 12 months old, eczema typically forms on areas of the body that babies use for crawling. It can look red or purple and inflamed. If infected, it may have a yellow crust on it. ",
        "What are the symptoms of eczema in older children?": "In toddlers under age 5 years, eczema usually affects the face. On lighter skin, it can look red and bumpy. On darker skin, it can look purplish or darker than surrounding skin. Eczema in toddlers can also look scaly and dry. You may notice deep lines on their skin. In children over 5 years old, eczema may look red and itchy or rash-looking on lighter skin. It may also look like permanent goosebumps and be thicker. On darker skin, the thickening may be hyperpigmented. Skin concerns may be a symptom of a different condition, so visiting a dermatologist can help determine whether the cause is eczema or something else. ",
        "Where is the most common place you may see symptoms?": "Certain body areas are more likely to be affected by eczema than others. This can change depending on your age. ",
        "Where is eczema on babies?": "In babies, eczema is often found on the scalp and face, particularly the cheeks. It’s most often found on the head, but it can develop anywhere. However, it does not typically occur in the diaper area. A baby may rub their face or head on the carpet or their bedsheets to scratch the itchy skin. This can further irritate the skin and lead to infection. As babies start to crawl, their eczema may be more frequently seen on their elbows or knees. This is because these areas are prone to rubbing as they crawl. In toddlers, eczema may often be seen on their face, around their mouth, or on their eyelids. It may also be on wrists, elbow creases, and knees. ",
        "Where is eczema on children?": "In older children, eczema typically appears: Sometimes other skin conditions can affect these areas, so it’s best to talk with a doctor for a definitive diagnosis. ",

        "What’s the difference between eczema and psoriasis?": "Diagnosing eczema can be tricky sometimes. Other skin conditions, like psoriasis, can look like eczema. A dermatologist can tell the difference. The underlying causes of psoriasis and eczema are different: Psoriasis itching tends to be mild, whereas the itching associated with eczema can be intense. In older adults, eczema is usually on the backs of the knees and inside the elbows. Psoriasis is often found on the scalp, elbows, knees, buttocks, and face. In children, eczema is more common than psoriasis. ",
        "What other conditions may look like eczema?": "Aside from psoriasis, other skin conditions can look like eczema. Knowing the underlying cause and identifying the condition correctly is the best way to get appropriate treatment. A dermatologist can diagnose the condition based on: Other conditions that may look similar to eczema include: ",
        "What is the treatment for eczema?": "There is no cure for eczema, but treatment and home remedies can manage symptoms. By working with a dermatologist or allergist, you can help reduce your chances of flare-ups and minimize symptoms. Treatment is based on three concepts, according to the National Eczema Association: There is no one way to treat eczema. Specific treatment plans can consider the type of eczema you have, your age, and the severity of the condition. What works for one person may not work for another. Most important for babies, children, and adults alike is to have a regular bathing and moisturizing routine. This helps keep water in your skin and control flares. Your doctor can provide techniques based on your specific situation. Knowing what triggers eczema flares can help you avoid anything that would cause a flare-up or irritation. Medication may be OTC or prescription depending on the type and severity of your eczema. OTC medications can include: Prescription treatments can include: For children, according to 2020 research, dietary guidelines may help if there is a food-related allergy that triggers eczema. If the outbreaks are stress-related, therapy may be helpful. ",
        "What is the outlook for people with eczema?": "Even without a cure, you can treat eczema in various ways. If one treatment doesn’t work, talk with your doctor about trying another. More and more research is being done on possible treatments. By following your doctor’s treatment plan and lifestyle strategies, you can help minimize symptoms of eczema and manage skin irritation. ",
        "The takeaway": "Symptoms of eczema can vary depending on the type of eczema and your age. Sometimes other skin conditions, like psoriasis, can mimic symptoms of eczema, so it’s always a good idea to visit a dermatologist to get an accurate diagnosis. Once a correct diagnosis is made, it determines which treatment may work best for you. "

        "Learning the link between my body and my diet": "I struggled with eczema for 2 years. It would come and go in waves, sometimes just a few spots on my knuckles, other times spreading across my fingers and the palms of my hands. It wasn’t until my third year of college that I took steps to adjust my diet to see if I could manage the condition better. I was never a junk-food-every-day kind of college student, but my sugar and alcohol consumption were high. I’d crave sweet things daily and get antsy if I wasn’t them eating regularly. The first thing I changed was the amount of sugar in my diet. While sugar has not been shown to directly aggravate eczema, it seemed to make a difference for me. By reducing my sugar intake, limiting the amount of alcohol I was drinking, and making vegetables the main event of every meal, I was gradually able to manage my eczema. I also began eating more fermented food. Over time, I stopped craving sugar and started craving fermented food instead. My body began telling me what it really needed, not just what it wanted for an instant high. Now in my mid-20s, I rarely have eczema flare-ups, my skin is clearer, and I have more energy. The changes I made to my diet had a huge impact on my eczema and my overall health. ",
        "The changes that worked for me": "Some people find that following a vegan diet can help their eczema. Others choose to cut out gluten, eggs, and shellfish. Something I learned through the process of treating my eczema is that everyone’s body is unique. The diets that work for some people won’t work for others. I quickly realized that extreme dietary changes made my eczema worse, so I learned to adjust my diet gradually. I also knew that I couldn’t maintain any major changes to my diet unless they meant I could still have varied, interesting, and tasty meals every day. I made a diet plan that allowed me to keep making food that tastes amazing, but is good to my body, too. The changes that helped me include: Although these changes coincided with improvements in my eczema, they may or may not improve eczema in others. We’re all different, and different things work for different people. In the first year, I was vigilant about my diet. I avoided refined sugar completely and took a strict approach to what I could and couldn’t eat. Over time, I’ve relaxed these measures (hello, Christmas!), but they’re still rules that guide my eating habits. If I feel like I’m getting another flare-up, I revert back to this diet for a month or so and monitor how I’m feeling along the way. ",
        "Gut health and eczema": "Scientists are now beginning to understand the role of the human microbiome in the appearance of chronic conditions like eczema. Recent studies have drawn a link between eczema and the health of the skin microbiome. However, there’s also evidence that gut health is a major factor in the cause and treatment of eczema. Research has shown that gut health is closely associated with the appearance of eczema in childhood. This means that what we eat as children could increase our chances of developing childhood eczema. As we get older, lifestyle factors can also affect our gut health and may lead to the development of eczema, as I experienced. ",
        "Fermented food to help with eczema": "I worked on rebuilding my gut health by making changes to my diet, especially increasing my intake of fermented foods. Fermented foods can bolster the gut microbiome by introducing friendly bacteria into the body. While studies looking at probiotics to treat eczema have had mixed results, there’s a growing understanding in allergy research that probiotics and probiotic-containing food are important routes to reducing atopic disease in the Western world. Fermented food intake has been linked to a reduced likelihood of eczema in adults. Researchers also found that mothers who eat more yogurt and fermented food during pregnancy can reduce the risk of eczema in their infants. I’ve been making kombucha since my second year of college on the advice of a family friend. This introduced me to the world of fermenting, and I kept experimenting with new things from there. Some of the fermented foods I now eat or drink daily include: I also experiment with seasonal variations, like lacto-fermented lemonade, pineapple tepache, and fermented cucumber. Yum! Having a wide variety of fermented foods and drinks on hand makes it easier to incorporate into every meal. Sauerkraut 7 days a week can get repetitive. I find that the more fermented food options I have in my fridge, the more likely I am to eat them. ",
        "Other foods to help with eczema": "As well as upping the amount of fermented food in my diet, I also worked on increasing the quantity and variety of vegetables I eat every day. The gut microbiome benefits from diets high in prebiotic foods. Prebiotic foods contain fiber that are resistant to breaking down in the stomach, and so they’re fermented by bacteria in the intestine instead. This helps stimulate the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria. High fiber foods include fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Rather than only eating salads, which can get boring pretty quickly, I started taking inspiration from South Asian cuisine. I began making more vegetarian and vegan dishes that were high in vegetables and had the added benefit of tons of anti-inflammatory spices. ",
        "Finding a balance": "Rebuilding the gut microbiome is a continual process. Every food choice you make has an effect on your gut health. Research has suggested that your gut microbiota can change in as little as 24 hours. By understanding the link between the skin and the rest of the body, it makes it easier to find a balance. I now see my eczema as my body telling me when my habits need a tuneup, whether that’s my diet, sleep, or stress levels. Flare-ups are like a red flag, telling me that I need to take a break and reset. Nowadays, I make sure I listen.

Eczema is common in children, but people of all ages can develop it. As many as 31 million Americans have some type of eczema. Sometimes called “the itch that rashes,” eczema may begin itching even before the rash becomes full-blown. Scratching the itch contributes to development of the rash. Eczema is not contagious. Eczema often appears as patches of irritated, red or reddish-gray skin. Over time, small, fluid-filled bumps that ooze and crust over may develop.

They may also use a light to look inside your ears to check for any irritation of your external ear canal. Depending on your symptoms and medical history, they may also do a biopsy. This involves taking a small sample of skin cells from the affected area and looking at it under a microscope. A biopsy of the skin tissue of your ear can help your doctor rule out similar conditions, such as psoriasis. ",

If you have allergic eczema, you might need to stop using certain products or wearing earrings, to narrow down what’s causing the irritation. If you still can’t figure out what’s causing it, you may need to undergo allergy testing. If you have seborrheic eczema, you may need to apply an antifungal ointment to the affected part of your ear. Your doctor might also prescribe a topical steroid to reduce inflammation, especially if the skin behind your ear is affected. If you have symptoms in your external ear canal, your doctor can prescribe steroid ear drops. It’s important to keep the area moisturized, regardless of the type of eczema you have. Avoid using harsh soaps and cleansers around your ears, which can dry out your skin and make your symptoms worse. Instead, look for a gentle cleanser. Shop for one designed for eczema-prone skin. You should then follow up with a moisturizer that contains colloidal oatmeal. Try one like this. Colloidal oatmeal is a natural anti-inflammatory with proven benefits for protecting and soothing dry, irritated skin. Try to stick with products that have the seal of acceptance by the National Eczema Association. These products have been evaluated to ensure they don’t contain any known skin irritants, which can make eczema worse.

        "The dairy/eczema debate": "Dairy products are a common source of food allergies, and consuming dairy may make eczema symptoms worse if you’re allergic. As a result, many people who experience eczema exclude dairy from their diet. However, the story is more complicated than that. Dairy foods are nutrient-rich, providing a range of vitamins and minerals that are vital to a healthy diet. These include vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium. A high-dairy diet has also been linked to lower blood pressure in middle-aged adults. Dairy is a key source of calcium for children and adolescents. A 2019 study has shown that when dairy is excluded, many people don’t increase their intake of other calcium-rich foods to compensate. On top of that, simply cutting out dairy completely may not be the most effective way to treat eczema. While dairy can aggravate symptoms of eczema for some people, a 2019 study has shown that some types of fermented dairy can actually help eczema. Fermented dairy, such as yogurt, is an important source of probiotics, which can treat eczema by improving the gut and skin microbiome. Daily consumption of yogurt has also been linked to reduced inflammation. Additional research supports this theory, showing that children whose mothers consumed fermented dairy during pregnancy were less likely to experience eczema. ",
        "Cow’s milk vs. other milks": "Some types of dairy could be more effective at treating eczema than others. A 2020 study has suggested that goat’s milk is easier to digest than cow’s milk and may be linked to a reduced chance of allergic diseases in infants. Researchers in Turkey found that children living with a cow’s milk allergy and atopic dermatitis were also sensitive to goat and sheep’s milk but had no reaction to camel’s milk. A Polish study showed that drinking mare’s milk could be beneficial for a range of chronic conditions, such as eczema. This included drinking fresh mare’s milk or fermented mare’s milk, known as kumis, a traditional drink in Central Asia. ",
        "Types of fermented dairy": "Kefir and yogurt are the types of probiotic-rich fermented dairy that have been studied the most. While not strictly a fermented food, there’s also evidence that raw milk could be beneficial for treating eczema. There are many types of traditional fermented dairy foods and drinks that are an integral part of folk medicine around the world, including: These foods haven’t received a lot of scientific attention. As a result, the evidence for their influence on eczema is only just starting to be explored. In most modern western diets, there tends to be a limited understanding of fermented dairy products. Most people are familiar with yogurt and kefir, but there’s actually a whole range of fermented dairy products out there. Many of these foods and drinks have a completely different texture and flavor to most of the products you can find in your local store. Some fermented dairy products that may be beneficial for your health and your eczema include: ",
        "Incorporating fermented dairy into your diet": "I developed eczema in my first year of college, but over time I’ve learned how to manage my symptoms through my diet. I chose not to cut out dairy, but I do make sure that most of the dairy I eat is fermented. If you’re looking to increase the amount of fermented dairy in your diet, I recommend looking for some diverse fermented products. Eating yogurt with every meal would definitely get boring! I like to make my own yogurt, labneh, kefir, and clabber. I also find loads of ways to use whey, a byproduct of making strained yogurt and cheese. I use it for baking, smoothies, and salad dressings. Try to find artisanal products that haven’t been pasteurized. Make sure you read the label so you know what you’re buying. You can also get inventive with how you eat fermented dairy by including both sweet and savory dishes. Some ideas include: ",
        "Making your own fermented dairy": "Many popular foods are fermented. However, the beneficial microbes may have been killed off through pasteurization. In the United States, most of the dairy you can find in stores has been heat-treated to help extend the shelf life and eliminate the risk of potentially pathogenic bacteria. The downside of this is your body doesn’t benefit from the probiotic bacteria that naturally occur in fermented dairy and help to support gut health. How can you get around this? For starters, you can try making your own fermented dairy products at home, including yogurt, kefir, and sour cream. It’s easier than you think! ",
        "Know your body": "Everyone’s body is different, and it’s important to find a diet that works for you. If the chance of a dairy allergy or intolerance has been ruled out, dairy can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. You may find that eating more fermented dairy could help treat your eczema.

Paget’s disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer that starts in the nipple and extends to the areola (the dark area of skin around the nipple). It’s commonly misdiagnosed as eczema of the breast or nipple, as the first symptoms are typically a red, scaly rash of the skin. Although the causes of Paget’s disease of the breast are unknown, many doctors believe it’s the result of a non-invasive underlying breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Cancer cells from an existing tumor in the tissues behind the nipple travel through the milk ducts to the nipple and areola. ",

        "What is laser treatment for eczema?": "Laser therapy is a type of photobiomodulation, or light therapy. It uses light to create a physiological effect in cells and tissue. Depending on specific needs, different types of wavelengths and light sources may be used. Some treatments use lasers, and some use light-emitting diodes (LEDs), according to 2019 research. Research from 2014 has shown that one of the most effective forms of laser therapy comes from the excimer laser, which uses an ultraviolet B radiation system. The laser can effectively treat eczema in adults and children. ",

According to the National Eczema Association, a dermatologist may recommend laser therapy or another form of phototherapy (light therapy) if other forms of treatment do not help your eczema. With the excimer laser, your doctor will use a handheld device to focus treatment on specific parts of your body. It can be used all over your body, including your hands, feet, and scalp. If a healthcare professional uses another form of phototherapy, you may stand inside a machine that will direct light at either your whole body or only exposed areas. ",
        "Length of treatment": "Laser therapy sessions are typically short but require driving to the hospital or dermatologist’s office. You can expect the treatment to last for less than 1 minute at first and up to several minutes in later sessions.

        "Cost": "Costs of treatment varies across the country. If you have insurance, your plan may cover some or part of the cost if the treatment is medically necessary. Because it is often used when other treatments fail, your insurance may cover only the costs after other treatments have not produced adequate results. Contact your insurance provider to see how much of the treatments your plan will cover. ",
        "Does it work?": "Laser therapy can be an effective tool for treating eczema. In a 2016 study, researchers found that the excimer laser (308 nm) helped improve eczema flares on the hands and feet. In a study from 2014, researchers found that the same laser helped adults and children with pain and itchiness associated with eczema. Laser therapy may not work well for everyone despite the potential for success. The IQWiG notes that treatment can be time-consuming and challenging to maintain. Laser therapy can cause side effects, such as sunburn-like irritation and dried-out skin. Finally, it cannot make eczema go away on its own. To help avoid side effects, you should avoid sun exposure before and following the procedure. ",
        "Can lasers remove eczema scars?": "Eczema itself shouldn’t scar, but it may leave behind post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Like other forms of eczema, its cause is unknown. Allergens, including food allergens, may influence flare-ups. Exposure to nickel and cobalt may trigger or worsen symptoms of dyshidrotic eczema. Many foods may contain these metals in trace amounts. Nickel and cobalt may be found in: A dyshidrotic diet involves limiting foods that may contain these elements to help reduce flare-ups among people with hypersensitivity to these metals. There hasn’t been much research on low nickel and low cobalt diets for eczema. Still, the American Academy of Dermatology Association notes that some dermatologists may recommend a diet that assigns point values to food and drinks with these metals based on the amount of metal present. Then, people with these hypersensitivities track the points for what they consume to avoid going over a certain number. Foods high in vitamin C may help reduce nickel absorption, so eating plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables may help. These include: ",
        "Elimination diet": "An elimination diet may help those who don’t know their eczema triggers. A recent research review found that the diet may slightly lower eczema severity in some people, though more studies are needed. An elimination diet involves removing potential food triggers from your diet for a time and adding them slowly, one at a time, to monitor symptoms. It’s important to work with a dietitian to plan for an elimination diet to ensure you get enough nutrients. A 2017 survey of participants with eczema suggests that some foods were more likely to contribute to flare-ups for more people, including: Participants also noted that adding vegetables and organic foods to their diet sometimes improved symptoms. ",
        "A gluten-free diet": "Research suggests that celiac disease and eczema seem to go hand in hand for some people. This may be because of the genetic link between the disorders. Celiac disease is treated by removing gluten from the diet. If you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, in addition to eczema, you may see an improvement in your skin if you eliminate gluten. Gluten-free food has become very popular, and many foods are labeled gluten-free. Many wheat, rye, and barley products also have gluten-free substitutes available to buy. A little imagination goes a long way here. For example, you can use potato flakes instead of bread crumbs to coat chicken cutlets and almond flour instead of wheat flour for baking. ",
        "Mediterranean diet": "The Mediterranean diet is based on an eating plan common in the Mediterranean, in countries such as Greece, Italy, and Turkey. The diet emphasizes whole foods, plant-based foods, and lean protein over processed foods. It typically also limits the consumption of red meat and alcohol to a moderate amount. This diet emphasizes eating: It also includes moderate amounts of red wine, which contains the plant compound quercetin, consumed with meals. While little research supports the benefits of the Mediterranean diet for eczema, the omega-3 fatty acids and quercetin present in the diet may help lower inflammation. ",
        "Anti-inflammatory diet": "This food plan focuses on eliminating foods that increase inflammation and eating fiber-rich foods. Note that there’s no single anti-inflammatory diet, as a particular food may cause inflammation in one person but not another. In general, though, this diet places a strong emphasis on: Heavily processed foods are limited in this food plan. You’ll also eat less meat on this diet. An anti-inflammatory diet may help lower inflammation in your body, although research on eczema is mixed. ",
        "Foods to eat": "Certain foods may help with eczema even if you don’t follow a specific diet. Still, keep in mind any food allergies or sensitivities you have. Foods considered eczema-friendly may trigger a flare-up in those with an allergy to them. In general, beneficial foods for eczema may include: ",
        "Fatty fish": "You may be able to reduce your eczema symptoms by eating fatty fish such as salmon and herring. Fish oil contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which are anti-inflammatory. You may also consider taking a fish oil supplement, though more research is needed on its benefits for eczema. Your diet is your body’s main source of omega-3 fatty acids. It’s best to consume them through food rather than supplements if you can. ",
        "Foods containing quercetin": "Quercetin is a plant-based flavonoid. These natural compounds help give many flowers, fruits, and vegetables their rich color. Quercetin is also a powerful antioxidant and may lower inflammation in your body. Although more studies on people need to be done, some test tube research suggests that quercetin may benefit inflammatory skin diseases such as eczema. But more research in humans is needed. Foods high in quercetin include: ",
        "Foods containing probiotics": "Probiotic foods, such as yogurt, contain live cultures that affect your gut bacteria and help support a strong immune system. This may help reduce flare-ups or allergic reactions. Probiotic-rich foods include: ",
        "Foods to avoid": "What you eat may not directly cause eczema, but it can worsen or cause symptoms to flare up. This is especially true if you eat a food you’re allergic or sensitive to. Not everyone will have issues with the foods listed below, but common food allergies associated with eczema include: ",
        "Takeaway": "Many triggers may bring on eczema-related symptoms, including what you eat. There isn’t a single diet that reduces eczema symptoms in everyone, but a good rule of thumb is avoiding foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. Focus on a nutritious diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and lean protein. This may help reduce eczema flare-ups. "

        "Beets": "Beets are a root vegetable packed with nutrients. An antioxidant called betalain gives them their vibrant purple color. One small 2016 study explored the possible health benefits of beets. Participants drank beet juice for 2 weeks, had a break, and then ate cooked beets daily for 2 weeks. Both forms of beets lowered inflammatory markers in participants’ bodies, with beet juice having a greater effect. Beets in either form are worth including in your diet. Beets can be roasted and added to salads. They pair nicely with citrus fruits, balsamic vinegar, goat cheese, leafy greens, and nuts or seeds. Beets can also be juiced or added to smoothies. ",
        "Squash": "When squash starts showing up in the fields and the store, it’s a sure sign of cooler weather ahead. Squash is a diverse group that includes acorn squash, butternut squash, spaghetti squash, and so many more varieties. Squash is a source of many antioxidants. It’s also a great source of soluble fiber, which helps feed the healthy bacteria that live in your digestive tract. Research suggests that a diet high in soluble fiber helps support a healthier balance of gut bacteria. People with eczema have been shown to have less diverse colonies of microorganisms in their digestive tracts, and boosting that diversity may help with eczema. Squash is wonderful when roasted, made into soups, or added to curries. ",
        "Pears": "Pears are another cool-weather food packed with beneficial nutrients. They’re high in soluble fiber, which supports gut health, and rich in vitamin C, which may help reduce inflammation in your skin. Pears are excellent when eaten fresh. A pear is ripe when the neck of the pear is slightly soft. Pears can also be sliced and added to a salad. Pear sauce is a nice side dish or can be added to oatmeal or used in baked goods. ",
        "Kale": "Kale is a type of leafy green related to cabbage and broccoli. It’s high in beta carotene, a type of antioxidant. Your body can use beta carotene to make vitamin A, which is associated with better skin health. Kale is also high in vitamin C, another antioxidant that may play a role in managing eczema. You can use kale to make a salad or add shredded kale to stir-fries, rice bowls, or scrambled eggs. ",
        "Sweet potatoes": "Sweet potatoes are a source of soluble fiber, which helps support a healthy gut microbiome. Sweet potatoes are also rich in beta carotene, the antioxidant that gives them their beautiful orange hue. Your body can use beta carotene to meet your vitamin A needs. As with vitamin C, people with eczema have been shown to have lower levels of vitamin A. Consuming food sources of vitamin A may help with eczema symptoms. You can prepare sweet potatoes in many of the same ways as white potatoes — they can be roasted, mashed, or baked with toppings added. ",
        "Brussels sprouts": "Another form of leafy greens, Brussels sprouts are an excellent source of vitamin C, which is another nutrient involved in skin health. Skin typically contains high levels of vitamin C, but people with eczema have lower vitamin C levels. Research suggests that a higher intake of vitamin C may help reduce inflammation in the skin. If you’re having flashbacks of boiled Brussels sprouts, don’t despair! Try shredding Brussels sprouts into a salad. You can also roast them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, or even with some brown sugar for a hint of sweetness. ",
        "Pumpkin seeds": "If you’re carving a pumpkin for Halloween, make sure to save those seeds! Pumpkin seeds are a great source of zinc. Zinc is a nutrient found throughout your body. And some research has shown that low serum levels of zinc are associated with eczema. Once you’ve taken the seeds out of the pumpkin, rinsed them, and dried them, add olive oil and some spices, and then roast them in the oven. You can also buy pumpkin seeds that are ready to eat. Pumpkin seeds can be eaten on their own, enjoyed in a trail mix, or sprinkled onto soups, salads, or stir-fries. ",
        "Mushrooms": "Mushrooms are one potential source of vitamin D. In a 2018 research review exploring the connection between vitamin D and eczema in children, the authors noted that several studies have shown an association between low vitamin D levels and increased eczema symptoms. Wild mushrooms can be a quality source of vitamin D. Commercial mushrooms are sometimes grown under UV lights to boost their vitamin D content — because mushrooms create vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, just like humans. You can check the nutrition facts panel on a pack of mushrooms to find out their vitamin D content. Mushrooms can be roasted or sauteed and added to sandwiches, pasta, or rice dishes or served as a side on their own. ",
        "The takeaway": "While there’s no exact diet for eczema management, certain nutrients — including vitamins A, C, and D; soluble fiber; and zinc — may help relieve skin symptoms. And there are many fresh food sources of these nutrients to enjoy in the cooler winter weather. "

However, many people with the skin condition have a personal or family history of: Atopic dermatitis is a skin condition that causes itchy or scaly rashes. People with nummular eczema also tend to have sensitive skin that gets irritated easily. The following factors may also contribute to the development of nummular eczema: ",
        "What are the symptoms of nummular eczema?": "The most common and noticeable symptom of nummular eczema is a patch of coin-shaped lesions on the body. The lesions frequently develop on the arms or legs but may eventually spread to the torso and hands. They may be brown, pink, red, or purplish, depending on your skin color. Symptoms of nummular eczema may include: Nummular eczema can also lead to a skin infection requiring urgent medical treatment. Symptoms of a skin infection can include: When nummular eczema begins to heal, the spots may become flatter. You may also have skin color changes known as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (skin darkening) or hypopigmentation (skin lightening) around the flat spot. This tends to occur more often in people with skin of color and can last for several months. If nummular eczema returns, a new flare-up may show up as a large, raised patch on top of an old, healing spot instead of a coin-shaped lesion. ",
        "What can be mistaken for nummular eczema?": "Nummular eczema lesions can look similar to ringworm, which is a fungal infection of the skin. Ringworm (tinea corporis) also tends to cause itchy bumps that become round, itchy, and scaly patches with a clear center. They may look red or pink on lighter skin or brown and gray on darker skin. Both can be very itchy. Ringwork tends to go away with 2 to 3 weeks of treatment but may last longer. A dermatologist can perform an exam and tell the difference between these two conditions and other conditions, like psoriasis, that may look similar. ",
        "How is nummular eczema diagnosed?": "A doctor may be able to diagnose nummular eczema by asking you about your medical history and visually inspecting your skin. They may also take a skin sample by superficially scraping the skin to check for ringworm. They may look under a microscope to see if there is fungus present. If you have a biopsy, a dermatopathologist may also analyze the skin cells to determine whether the rash is nummular eczema or another skin condition. If your doctor suspects the lesions are a result of an external allergic reaction, they may also perform an allergy test. This test is done in the doctor’s office. It involves leaving a patch on your skin for several days and watching for a reaction. If you don’t already have a dermatologist, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool. ",

You may also need to see a doctor to rule out other skin disorders that can look like nummular dermatitis. A healthcare professional such as a dermatologist can also prescribe medications to treat nummular eczema. These may include: If symptoms do not go away even after medicated treatment, your symptoms may be due to an allergic reaction. Your doctor may then recommend a patch test to identify the source of the allergy. ",
        "Lifestyle changes": "There is no cure for nummular eczema. However, you may be able to manage your symptoms with certain lifestyle measures and by avoiding triggers. Doctors may recommend avoiding: The following can help relieve your eczema: Be sure to talk with your healthcare professional before making changes to your treatment plan. ",
        "Nummular eczema diet": "There isn’t a specific diet for nummular eczema. Generally speaking, people with eczema may want to consider eating a nutrient-rich, balanced diet and doing their best to maintain a moderate body weight. Guidelines broadly suggest avoiding or limiting highly processed foods and allergy-causing foods, as these may have an association with eczema flare-ups. One way to do this is to follow an anti-inflammatory diet. ",

        "Foods to avoid": "Examples of inflammatory foods to avoid or limit include: For more specific guidelines on a personalized eating lifestyle, speak with your doctor to learn more about health-promoting eating and lifestyle eating patterns. ",
        "Research on nummular eczema diet": "When it comes to nummular eczema specifically, a 2021 study showed that a gluten-free diet may help you manage the symptoms of the condition. In this case, an 11-year-old girl was able to remain completely symptom-free while avoiding all gluten. However, more research is needed to confirm whether this is true beyond this case. A 2020 study also showed there may be some benefit to L-His supplementation. This is a supplement containing the amino acid histidine, which the body metabolizes into histamine. Histidine is an amino acid involved with growth and immunity. The research shows it may improve the symptoms of severe nummular eczema that is resistant to other treatments. ",
        "Who is at risk for nummular eczema?": "Nummular eczema tends to occur more often in males than in females. Males usually have their first episode after age 50 and females before age 30, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AAD). Some children with severe atopic dermatitis may develop nummular eczema. The following conditions may increase your risk of developing nummular eczema, according to the AAD: ",
